# DEADPAN — Marketing Plan

**Marketing Lead**: HYPE
**Game**: Stand-up Comedy Empire Simulation
**Target Platform**: PC (Steam) primary, Nintendo Switch secondary
**Status**: Pre-Production Marketing Strategy
**Date**: February 7, 2026

---

## 1. THE HOOK (Three Versions)

Marketing is about the 5-second scroll-stop. Here are three versions of the hook, calibrated for different audiences and contexts.

### Version 1: The Elevator Pitch (One Sentence)

**"Build jokes from cards, perform them to AI audiences that can heckle you, and claw your way from open-mic nobody to Netflix special — this is Game Dev Tycoon meets the Comedy Store."**

**Where This Lives**: Steam short description (300 characters max), social media bios, press pitch subject lines, Discord server tagline, trailer end card.

**Why It Works**: It answers three questions in fifteen seconds:
1. What do I DO? (Build jokes, perform them)
2. What's the twist? (AI audiences that heckle)
3. What's the arc? (Open mic to Netflix)

The "Game Dev Tycoon meets the Comedy Store" comp does the heavy lifting — tycoon players know EXACTLY what this is. Comedy fans get curious because nobody's made this game yet.

---

### Version 2: The Scroll-Stop Paragraph (Three Sentences)

**"You bombed last night. Now you're sitting in your apartment with a notebook, a cold coffee, and a question: do I still have it? DEADPAN is a stand-up comedy simulation where you construct jokes from modular components, perform them to reactive AI audiences, and build a career from dive bar open mics to sold-out theaters — where every crowd is different, every bomb teaches you something, and the distance between who you are on stage and who you are off stage is the whole game."**

**Where This Lives**: Steam long description (first paragraph), press release opening, Reddit /r/Games announcement post, Kickstarter pitch (if applicable), festival submission blurbs.

**Why It Works**: It opens with EMOTION (you bombed — immediate empathy from anyone who's ever failed publicly). It explains the MECHANICS in human terms (construct jokes, perform them, build a career). It hints at the THEME (the distance between selves). And it ends with stakes that aren't about winning — they're about meaning.

---

### Version 3: The Full Pitch (One Page)

**You bombed last night.**

That's where DEADPAN starts. Not at the beginning of a comedy career — in the wreckage of one. You had a set at a mid-level club and you ate it. Hard. The room went cold. A heckler got the biggest laugh of the night. Your agent hasn't called back.

Now you're sitting in your apartment with a notebook and a question: *Do I still have it?*

DEADPAN is a stand-up comedy empire simulation where joke construction is a craft system, audiences are living ecosystems, and the mic is the loneliest place on earth. You build jokes from modular components — Premise, Setup, Misdirection, Punchline, Tags, Callbacks — using a card-based Bit Builder that makes comedy feel like carpentry. You arrange those jokes into setlists, book gigs at venues ranging from dive bar open mics to Madison Square Garden, and perform to AI audiences that react in real time.

Every audience is different. A Tuesday open mic at a Brooklyn bar is 60% fellow comedians, 20% regulars, 20% walk-ins. A Saturday headliner at The Comedy Store is 30% comedy nerds, 25% date night couples, 20% industry scouts. The Crowd Engine simulates individual preferences, collective momentum, patience stats, and volatility — audiences laugh, heckle, walk out, record you on their phones, and go viral. The Laugh Graph visualizes every reaction as a waveform, so you can see EXACTLY which joke killed and which transition lost them.

Your Voice Identity evolves based on what you perform. Go dark and confrontational, build a cult following. Go clean and observational, get the sitcom deal. Stay authentic to your voice, earn fan loyalty. Chase trends, lose your core audience. The game tracks Authenticity and gates career paths accordingly. There is no "correct" path — there are fifteen paths, and the one that maximizes metrics is not always the one that maximizes meaning.

The comedy world is alive. 15-20 AI comedians populate the scene, each with their own career trajectory, material library, and relationship with you. They compete for gig slots. They steal your bits if you're not careful. They become collaborators, rivals, mentors, cautionary tales. The scene remembers your first bomb and your breakout set, and those memories shape how bookers, agents, and audiences treat you.

The career arc spans five years and six tiers: Open Mic, Barker, Featuring Act, Headliner, Draw, Empire. At Tier 6, you tape your special — a 60-minute set performed to a packed theater, recorded for broadcast. The setlist is your choice. The performance is the culmination of everything you learned. And after the special, the game asks: what comes next?

DEADPAN is the tycoon game nobody knew they were waiting for because nobody's ever made a real stand-up comedy simulation. There are party games with comedy themes. There are rhythm games with joke timing. But nobody's built a game where you CONSTRUCT jokes from components, perform them to REACTIVE AI audiences, and manage a COMEDY CAREER from open mics to HBO specials.

This is a blue ocean product. It's not competing with other comedy games because there are no other comedy games. It's competing with tycoon games on novelty and comedy content on interactivity — and it wins both fights.

**The hook in five seconds**: "A game where you build jokes and perform them to AI audiences that can heckle you."

That sentence has never been true before. It stops every scroll.

**Where This Lives**: Press kit one-pager, investor deck, internal pitch doc, long-form blog announcement, IGN/PC Gamer exclusive reveal article.

## 2. TARGET AUDIENCE

Marketing starts with knowing WHO you're talking to and WHERE they already are. DEADPAN has three audience segments with minimal overlap. Each requires different messaging and different channels.

### Primary Audience: Tycoon and Simulation Players (Core Market)

**Who They Are**:
- Age: 20-40
- Gender: 60% male, 35% female, 5% non-binary (based on Steam tycoon demographics)
- Games They Play: Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, Software Inc., Music Inc., Football Manager, Slay the Spire, Stardew Valley
- Platforms: PC (Steam) overwhelmingly primary. Some Switch.
- Communities: /r/tycoon, /r/simulation, /r/BaseBuildingGames, /r/indiegames, /r/gamedev (lurking)
- Psychographics: They love systems. They love mastery curves. They want a tycoon game in a setting they've never seen before. They wishlist aggressively and buy on day one when the concept is novel.

**What They Want from DEADPAN**:
- Deep, iterable systems (the Bit Builder satisfies the "one more turn" itch)
- Progression with teeth (career gating, unlocks, tier climbs)
- Novelty (stand-up comedy is an untapped setting)
- Replayability (Voice Identity system creates divergent playthroughs)

**Messaging for This Audience**:
- Lead with MECHANICS: "Modular joke construction system. Reactive AI audiences. Career simulation from open mic to Netflix special."
- Emphasize DEPTH: "The Bit Builder has thousands of viable joke combinations. The Crowd Engine tracks individual audience archetypes. The Voice Identity system gates career paths based on authenticity."
- Use COMPS: "Game Dev Tycoon meets the Comedy Store. Music Inc. meets Papers Please."

**Channels**:
- Steam store optimization (tags, capsule art, trailer)
- Reddit: /r/tycoon, /r/BaseBuildingGames, /r/gamedev (post as dev, engage in comments)
- YouTube: Reach out to Let's Players who cover tycoon games (SplatterCatGaming, Wanderbots, Retromation)
- Steam wishlists: Start building the list 6-12 months before launch. Target: 10,000+ wishlists at launch.

---

### Secondary Audience: Comedy Fans and Podcast Listeners (Crossover Market)

**Who They Are**:
- Age: 18-35
- Gender: 50% male, 45% female, 5% non-binary (comedy audiences skew slightly more balanced than gaming)
- Media They Consume: Netflix comedy specials (weekly), comedy podcasts (Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend, Kill Tony, WTF with Marc Maron, The Comedy Store docuseries), live stand-up shows
- Communities: /r/standup, /r/Comedy, Twitter comedy communities, TikTok comedy clips, Instagram comedy pages
- Platforms: Many are NOT traditional gamers. Mobile and Switch are entry points. PC if they have it.
- Psychographics: They love comedy as a craft. They've watched enough specials to appreciate joke structure. They're curious about the "behind the scenes" of a comedy career. They want to feel what it's like to stand in the spotlight.

**What They Want from DEADPAN**:
- AUTHENTICITY: The game has to "get it." If the Bit Builder feels like a spreadsheet instead of joke writing, they bounce.
- NARRATIVE: They want to feel the emotional arc — bombing, grinding, breaking out, empire.
- SPECIFICITY: Dive bars that feel like dive bars. Green rooms that smell like stale beer. The Comedy Store that looks like The Comedy Store.

**Messaging for This Audience**:
- Lead with EMOTION: "You bombed last night. Do you still have it?"
- Emphasize CRAFT: "Build jokes from components — Premise, Setup, Misdirection, Punchline. The Bit Builder is a tool for understanding joke structure."
- Use STORY: "From open mic to Netflix special. Every bomb teaches you. Every crowd is different. The game understands that funny isn't universal — funny is situational."

**Channels**:
- Comedy podcast ad buys (30-second pre-roll: "If you've ever wondered what it's like to build a comedy career from scratch, there's a game for that.")
- Comedian influencer partnerships (see Section 7)
- TikTok comedy community (clips of the Crowd Engine reacting to player-built jokes are inherently shareable)
- Twitter comedy circles (engage with comedians, share dev insights about joke construction)
- Reddit: /r/standup (post as "I'm making a stand-up comedy sim and I want to get it right — what should I know?")

---

### Tertiary Audience: Creative Professionals and Aspiring Comedians (Niche Evangelists)

**Who They Are**:
- Age: 22-40
- Professions: Writers, improv performers, comedy students, screenwriters, podcasters, YouTubers
- Psychographics: They see the Bit Builder as a TOOL, not just a game mechanic. They'll use it to workshop real material. They'll evangelize DEADPAN because it's the first game that treats comedy as a craft with learnable structure.

**What They Want from DEADPAN**:
- EDUCATION: The game teaches joke construction in a way that transfers to real comedy writing.
- COMMUNITY: A place to share setlists, compare Voice Identities, discuss strategy.
- RESPECT: The game doesn't parody comedy — it respects it.

**Messaging for This Audience**:
- Lead with CRAFT: "DEADPAN is a tool for understanding joke structure. Build a joke. Test it on an AI audience. Learn why it worked or didn't."
- Emphasize DEPTH: "The Bit Builder uses the same frameworks working comedians use: setup, misdirection, punchline, callbacks."
- Use VALIDATION: "We talked to working comedians. We studied joke theory. This game gets it."

**Channels**:
- Comedy writing courses and communities (post on /r/Screenwriting, comedy writing forums)
- Improv and stand-up classes (reach out to instructors: "Would this be useful as a teaching tool?")
- YouTube comedy analysis channels (reach out to creators who break down joke structure)

---

### Audience Overlap and Conversion Strategy

The magic happens when Audience 1 (tycoon players) discovers the game is ALSO emotionally resonant, and Audience 2 (comedy fans) discovers the game is ALSO mechanically deep. The trailer, Steam page, and early messaging must speak to BOTH.

**Conversion Funnel**:
1. **Awareness**: Reddit post, trailer, podcast ad, influencer tweet
2. **Interest**: Click to Steam page. Read description. Watch trailer.
3. **Desire**: Wishlist. Join Discord. Follow dev Twitter.
4. **Action**: Buy on launch day.

**Key Metrics to Track**:
- Steam wishlist conversion rate (industry average: 15-20% of wishlists convert to sales in week one; target: 25% because this is a novel concept with built-in hype)
- Social engagement rate (retweets, Reddit upvotes, Discord activity)
- Press coverage (number of outlets covering the game, sentiment analysis)

---

## 3. MARKETING TIMELINE (Beats and Deliverables)

Marketing is not a phase — it's a practice that runs parallel to development from the first commit. Here's the beat-by-beat plan from announcement to post-launch.

### PHASE 1: Silent Build (Months -12 to -6 Before Announcement)

**What's Happening**: The game is in early prototype. Core loop is playable but not polished. No public presence yet.

**Marketing Tasks**:
- Build the foundation
  - Register social media handles (Twitter: @DeadpanGame, Instagram: @deadpangame, TikTok: @deadpangame)
  - Set up Discord server (keep it private for now; invite playtest friends and advisors only)
  - Create Steam page placeholder (not live yet, but configured in Steamworks)
  - Commission key art (brick wall, spotlight, mic stand — this is the hero image for EVERYTHING)
  - Write the three-version hook (elevator pitch, scroll-stop, full pitch)
  - Identify influencer targets (tycoon YouTubers, comedy podcasters, comedian Twitter accounts)

**Deliverables**:
- Social media accounts created but dormant
- Key art finalized (4K resolution, press-ready)
- Steam page copy drafted (short description, long description, feature list)
- Influencer outreach list (50 targets: 30 gaming, 20 comedy)

**Goal**: Have all infrastructure ready so that when announcement happens, it's IMMEDIATE.

---

### PHASE 2: The Announcement (Month -6 to -5)

**What's Happening**: The Bit Builder vertical slice is done. The player can assemble a joke, perform it to a small audience, and see the Laugh Graph. This is enough to show what the game IS.

**The Moment**: The announcement is the first scroll-stop. It has to be PERFECT.

**Beat 1: The GIF (Week 1 of Phase 2)**

The single most important marketing asset is a 5-second GIF:
1. Hands dragging joke component cards onto a napkin
2. Cards snap together with a satisfying click
3. Cut to: spotlight hits the stage
4. Cut to: audience reacts (heads tilt back, laughter)
5. Cut to: Laugh Graph spikes in Spotlight Gold
6. End card: "DEADPAN. Wishlist Now."

This GIF is the entire game in five seconds. It will be posted on Twitter, embedded in the Reddit announcement, sent to press, used in every context where attention spans are measured in milliseconds.

**Beat 2: The Reddit Post (Week 1 of Phase 2)**

Post to /r/indiegaming, /r/tycoon, /r/gamedev, /r/standup, /r/Games.

**Title**: "I'm making a stand-up comedy tycoon game where you build jokes from cards and perform them to AI audiences that can heckle you. Here's the first look."

**Post Body**:
- Brief intro (2-3 sentences: who I am, why I'm making this, what it is)
- The GIF (embedded)
- Feature list (bullet points: Bit Builder, Crowd Engine, Voice Identity, career arc)
- Link to Steam page (wishlist CTA)
- "I'm here to answer questions. AMA."

**Expected Response**: 500-2,000 upvotes on /r/Games if the GIF is good. 200-500 on /r/tycoon. The comments will reveal what resonates and what confuses. ENGAGE IN THE COMMENTS. Answer every question. This is the first impression.

**Beat 3: The Steam Page Goes Live (Week 1 of Phase 2)**

The Steam page is the conversion engine. It must be PERFECT.

Components:
- **Capsule art** (header, library, hero): Brick wall, spotlight, mic stand, Laugh Graph waveform. Clean, iconic, scroll-stopping.
- **Trailer** (60 seconds): Opens with "You bombed last night." Shows the Bit Builder, the performance, the Laugh Graph, the career arc. Ends with "Wishlist Now."
- **Short description** (300 characters): Version 1 hook.
- **Long description**: Version 2 hook + feature list + "What makes this different" section.
- **Screenshots** (10 images): Bit Builder, performance view, Laugh Graph, setlist napkin, venue selection, career screen, green room, special taping.
- **Tags**: Simulation, Management, Singleplayer, Indie, Strategy, Card Game, Choose Your Own Adventure, Comedy, Emotional, Story Rich.
- **Release Date**: TBD (placeholder: Q4 2026).

**Goal**: 1,000 wishlists in week one. 5,000 wishlists by end of Phase 2.

**Beat 4: Press Outreach (Week 2 of Phase 2)**

Send personalized pitches to 30 outlets:

**Tier 1 (Major Coverage)**:
- PC Gamer, IGN, Kotaku, Rock Paper Shotgun, Polygon, Eurogamer

**Tier 2 (Indie-Focused)**:
- IndieGames.com, Indie Game Enthusiast, Siliconera, TouchArcade (if mobile version planned)

**Tier 3 (Comedy/Culture)**:
- The Ringer (gaming section), Vulture, AV Club, Paste Magazine

**Pitch Template**:

Subject: "DEADPAN — The First Stand-Up Comedy Tycoon Game (Exclusive First Look?)"

Body:
"Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], and I'm making DEADPAN — a stand-up comedy simulation where you build jokes from modular components, perform them to reactive AI audiences, and manage a career from open mics to Netflix specials.

Think Game Dev Tycoon meets the Comedy Store.

The hook: You construct jokes using a card-based Bit Builder (Premise + Setup + Misdirection + Punchline), then perform them to AI audiences that react in real time based on their preferences, patience, and volatility. Every crowd is different. Every bomb teaches you something. The Laugh Graph shows you exactly which joke killed and which transition lost them.

Nobody's made this game yet. Stand-up comedy is a blue ocean for tycoon/sim games, and the crossover audience (comedy fans who've never played a management sim) is massive.

I'm offering an exclusive first look if you're interested. I have a playable vertical slice, the announcement GIF, key art, and a full press kit.

Let me know if this sounds like something your audience would dig.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Link to Steam Page]
[Link to Press Kit]"

**Expected Coverage**: 5-10 outlets publish articles in weeks 2-4. Target: at least one Tier 1 outlet (PC Gamer or IGN).

**Beat 5: Influencer Outreach (Week 2-3 of Phase 2)**

Reach out to 30 YouTubers and streamers who cover tycoon/sim games.

**Targets**:
- SplatterCatGaming (tycoon specialist, 500K subs)
- Wanderbots (sim games, 300K subs)
- Retromation (indie sim, 200K subs)
- Quill18 (strategy/management, 500K subs)
- Blitz (tycoon games, 150K subs)

**Pitch**:
"Hey [Name], I'm making a stand-up comedy tycoon game where you build jokes from cards and perform them to AI audiences. It's Game Dev Tycoon meets the Comedy Store. Would you be interested in early access for a video when we get closer to launch? No obligations — just thought it might be up your alley."

**Goal**: 5-10 YouTubers express interest. Follow up with Steam keys when the game is in Early Access or at launch.

**Deliverables by End of Phase 2**:
- 5,000+ Steam wishlists
- 5-10 press articles published
- 10,000+ impressions on social media (Twitter, Reddit combined)
- 5-10 influencers committed to coverage

---

### PHASE 3: The Devlog Drip (Months -5 to -2)

**What's Happening**: The game is in full production. Systems are being built. Art is being finalized. This is the "keep the audience warm" phase.

**Strategy**: Weekly or bi-weekly devlog posts across Reddit, Twitter, Discord. Each post highlights ONE system or feature, with a GIF or screenshot.

**Devlog Topics** (12 posts over 3 months):

1. "How the Bit Builder Works: Joke Construction as a Craft System"
2. "Meet the Crowd Engine: Why Every Audience Is Different"
3. "The Laugh Graph: Your Post-Set Diagnostic Tool"
4. "Voice Identity: The Choice Between Authenticity and Success"
5. "The Comedy Scene: Rivals, Collaborators, and AI Comedians Who Remember"
6. "Venue Spotlight: The Dive Bar Open Mic"
7. "Venue Spotlight: The Comedy Store"
8. "Career Tiers: From Open Mic to Empire"
9. "The Art Direction: Napkins, Brick Walls, and Spotlight Gold"
10. "Sound Design: How We Made Laughter Feel Reactive"
11. "The Bomb: What Happens When a Set Dies (And Why It's Essential)"
12. "Early Access Announcement (If Applicable) or Launch Date Reveal"

**Format**:
- Title + 2-3 paragraphs of explanation
- GIF or screenshot
- "Wishlist on Steam" CTA
- Cross-post to Reddit (/r/indiegaming, /r/gamedev), Twitter, Discord

**Goal**: Keep wishlist velocity steady (500-1,000 new wishlists per month during this phase).

---

### PHASE 4: The Demo and Festival Circuit (Months -3 to -1)

**What's Happening**: The game is feature-complete. Time to get it in front of players.

**Beat 1: The Steam Demo**

Build a 30-45 minute demo:
- Tutorial: Bit Builder introduction (build 3 jokes)
- First open mic performance (8-person crowd, low stakes)
- Post-set Laugh Graph analysis
- Unlock: One additional venue (dive bar regular spot)
- Second performance with player-built setlist
- End screen: "This is just the beginning. Wishlist the full game."

**Demo Strategy**:
- Release during a Steam festival (Next Fest, October Fest, or February Fest)
- Promote heavily on Reddit, Twitter, Discord in the week leading up to the festival
- Track metrics: demo downloads, wishlist conversion rate (target: 30% of demo players wishlist the full game)

**Beat 2: Festival Submissions**

Submit to 5-10 indie game festivals:
- IndieCade
- PAX Indie Showcase
- Day of the Devs
- IGF (Independent Games Festival)
- SXSW Gaming

**Why Festivals Matter**: Press coverage, award nominations (which can be used in marketing: "IGF Finalist"), and community buzz.

**Goal**: At least one festival acceptance. Bonus if the game wins an award category (Best Design, Excellence in Narrative, etc.).

**Deliverables by End of Phase 4**:
- 20,000+ Steam wishlists
- 5,000+ demo downloads
- 1-2 festival showcases

---

### PHASE 5: The Launch Push (Month -1 to Launch Day)

**What's Happening**: The game is gold. All systems are final. Marketing shifts into overdrive.

**Week -4: The Launch Date Announcement**

Post across all channels:
- "DEADPAN launches on Steam [DATE]. Wishlist now so you don't miss it."
- Include: final trailer (90 seconds, shows all systems), launch discount teaser ("10% off for the first week"), pre-order option (if applicable)

**Week -3: Press Review Code Outreach**

Send Steam keys to 50 press outlets and influencers with embargo date (launch day).

**Pitch**:
"DEADPAN launches [DATE]. This is a stand-up comedy tycoon game where you build jokes from cards, perform them to AI audiences, and manage a career from open mics to Netflix specials. Requesting review coverage. Embargo: [LAUNCH DAY]."

**Week -2: Community Hype Campaign**

Run a Twitter/Reddit campaign:
- "Post your best bombing story with #DeadpanGame and we'll turn the top 5 into in-game Premise cards."
- Winner announcement week before launch. This generates UGC (user-generated content) and keeps the conversation active.

**Week -1: Launch Trailer Finale**

Release the final launch trailer (60-90 seconds):
- Opens with "You bombed last night."
- Shows the full career arc: open mic → grind → breakout → empire → the special
- Ends with launch date + "Available Now on Steam"
- Post everywhere: Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, Steam page, Discord

**Launch Day: The Coordinated Blitz**

- **Steam**: Game goes live. 10% launch discount (week one only). Featured in New Releases.
- **Press**: Embargo lifts. Reviews go live across 10-20 outlets.
- - **Influencers**: 10-20 YouTubers publish videos on launch day (coordinated via shared embargo).
- **Reddit**: "DEADPAN is out now" post on /r/Games, /r/indiegaming, /r/tycoon, /r/standup. Include launch trailer, feature list, Steam link.
- **Twitter**: Pin tweet: "DEADPAN is live. Build jokes. Bomb sets. Become a legend. [Steam Link]"
- **Discord**: Launch celebration event. Dev Q&A in voice chat.

**Launch Week Goals**:
- 5,000 units sold (week one)
- 50+ Steam reviews (target: "Very Positive" rating)
- 10+ press reviews published
- 20+ influencer videos

---

### PHASE 6: Post-Launch (Month +1 to +6)

**What's Happening**: The game is live. Marketing shifts to retention, word-of-mouth, and long-tail sales.

**Month +1: The First Update**

Release a content update (new joke components, new venue, balance tweaks). Announce it across all channels. This signals: "The game is actively supported."

**Month +2-3: Community Content Push**

Run community events:
- "Best User-Generated Setlist" contest (players share their funniest setlists on Discord/Reddit; winner gets in-game recognition or a physical prize)
- "Comedy Voice Quiz" (personality quiz: answer 5 questions, get your Voice Identity spectrum result as a shareable graphic)

**Month +3-6: The Long Tail**

- Seasonal sales (Steam Summer Sale, Winter Sale)
- Influencer re-engagement (send keys to new YouTubers who missed launch)
- Reddit AMAs ("I made a stand-up comedy sim that's sold 10K copies. AMA.")
- Consider Early Access roadmap (if the game launched in EA) or DLC announcement (if it launched full release)

**Metrics to Track Post-Launch**:
- Units sold per week (track decay rate; healthy is 10-15% decline per week)
- Steam reviews (maintain "Very Positive"; respond to negative reviews)
- Wishlist-to-sale conversion (industry average: 5-10% of wishlists convert in months 2-6)

---

## 4. STORE PAGE COPY (Steam Optimization)

The Steam page is the conversion engine. Every word, every image, every tag is a marketing decision.

### Short Description (300 Characters Max)

**"Build jokes from modular cards, perform them to AI audiences that heckle you, and claw your way from open-mic nobody to Netflix special. A stand-up comedy empire sim where funny isn't universal — it's situational. Game Dev Tycoon meets the Comedy Store."**

Character count: 297. Fits.

---

### Long Description (No Character Limit, But Keep It Scannable)

**You bombed last night.**

That's where DEADPAN starts. Not at the beginning of a comedy career — in the wreckage of one. You had a set at a mid-level club and you ate it. The room went cold. A heckler got the biggest laugh of the night. Your agent hasn't called back.

Now you're sitting in your apartment with a notebook and a question: *Do I still have it?*

---

**BUILD JOKES LIKE A CRAFTSPERSON**

DEADPAN's Bit Builder is a modular joke construction system. Every joke is assembled from components: Premise (the observation), Setup (the framing), Misdirection (where the audience thinks you're going), and Punchline (the actual destination). Optional Tags (extra punchlines) and Callbacks (references to earlier material) multiply the laughs.

Each component has stats across five humor axes: Cleverness, Relatability, Edge, Absurdity, and Physicality. The combination creates a Humor Profile — a fingerprint that determines which audiences will connect with it.

A high-Cleverness Setup + high-Absurdity Punchline creates a different joke than a high-Relatability Setup + high-Edge Punchline. Thousands of viable combinations. Simple to use, impossible to master.

---

**PERFORM TO LIVING AUDIENCES**

Every audience is a composition of archetypes: Comedy Nerds, Date Night Couples, Bachelor Parties, College Students, Industry Scouts, Drunk Hecklers, Fellow Comedians. Each archetype has preferences, patience, and the power to make or break you.

A Tuesday open mic at a dive bar is 60% fellow comedians, 20% regulars, 20% walk-ins. A Saturday headliner at The Comedy Store is 30% comedy nerds, 25% date night couples, 20% industry scouts. The Crowd Engine reacts in real time — collectively AND individually. You can lose one table while winning another.

The Laugh Graph visualizes every reaction as a waveform. Peaks are laughs. Valleys are silence. Spikes are eruptions. Flatlines are death. After every set, you review the graph and learn EXACTLY which joke killed and which transition lost them.

---

**BUILD A CAREER (OR BURN OUT TRYING)**

Six career tiers: Open Mic → Barker → Featuring Act → Headliner → Draw → Empire. Each tier changes the stakes, the audience composition, and what success means.

At Tier 1, you're learning that audiences are different. At Tier 4, you're managing a comedy empire while maintaining the creative spark that got you here. At Tier 6, you tape your special — a 60-minute set performed to a packed theater, recorded for broadcast. The setlist is your choice. The performance is the statement.

The game does not end at the special. It transforms. The question shifts from "how do I make it?" to "what kind of comic do I want to be remembered as?"

---

**CHOOSE YOUR VOICE (AND LIVE WITH IT)**

Your Voice Identity evolves based on what you perform. Five spectra: Observational vs. Absurdist, Clean vs. Dark, Political vs. Personal, Cerebral vs. Physical, Warm vs. Confrontational.

A Warm/Observational/Clean comic gets the sitcom deal. A Dark/Political/Confrontational comic gets the cult following and the podcast empire. The game tracks Authenticity — drift too far from your established voice and you lose your core fans before building new ones.

This is the central strategic tension: stay true or go broad? The game does not judge either choice. But it makes both choices feel meaningfully different.

---

**NAVIGATE THE SCENE**

The comedy world is populated with 15-20 AI comedians, each with their own Voice Identity, career trajectory, and relationship with you. They compete for gig slots. They steal your bits if you perform similar material on a smaller stage. They become collaborators (co-writing sessions, podcast guests, tour support) or rivals (active competition, audience overlap, scene drama).

The scene is alive. Comics rise, burn out, sell out, come back. You watch a fellow open-mic-er become a headliner. You watch a headliner flame out. The relationships are the connective tissue of the career simulation.

---

**KEY FEATURES**

- **Modular Joke Construction**: Build jokes from 300+ component cards across six types (Premise, Setup, Misdirection, Punchline, Tag, Callback). Thousands of combinations.

---

**WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT**

There has never been a stand-up comedy simulation. Not a real one. DEADPAN is a blue ocean product in a proven genre (tycoon/management sims) with a massive crossover audience (comedy fans).

The hook in five seconds: "A game where you build jokes and perform them to AI audiences that can heckle you."

That sentence has never been true before.

## 5. SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT PLAN

Social media is not about broadcasting — it's about starting conversations. The goal: build a community BEFORE launch so that on day one, there's already an audience waiting.

### Platform Strategy

**Twitter/X** (Primary Platform for Gaming + Comedy Crossover):
- Handle: @DeadpanGame
- Frequency: 3-5 posts per week during devlog phase, daily during launch week
- Content Types:
  - Dev updates (system showcases, GIFs of new features)
  - Comedy theory threads ("Why do callbacks work? Here's how DEADPAN models them.")
  - Community engagement (reply to everyone who mentions the game)
  - Memes (sparingly — only if they feel authentic to the voice)

**Reddit** (Primary Platform for Deep Engagement):
- Subreddits: /r/indiegaming, /r/tycoon, /r/gamedev, /r/standup, /r/Games
- Frequency: 1-2 posts per month during devlog phase, weekly during launch month
- Content Types:
  - "I'm making [DEADPAN]" devlog posts with GIFs/screenshots
  - AMAs ("I'm making a stand-up comedy sim. AMA about joke construction systems.")
  - Community questions ("What's your worst bombing story? I'm collecting Premise cards.")

**Discord** (Community Hub):
- Server Name: "The Green Room"
- Channels:
  - #announcements (dev updates)
  - #general (community chat)
  - #setlist-showcase (players share their best joke combos)
  - #feedback (bug reports, suggestions)
  - #off-topic (comedy talk, Netflix special recs)
- Goal: 500 members by launch, 2,000 by month +3

**TikTok** (Experimental, High Upside):
- Handle: @deadpangame
- Frequency: 1-2 posts per week (only if there's video content worth posting — don't force it)
- Content Types:
  - "POV: You're a comedian about to bomb" (vertical video of the performance view)
  - Joke construction process (speed-run of building a joke in the Bit Builder, 15 seconds)
  - Crowd reactions (compilation of AI audience members laughing, heckling, walking out)

**Instagram** (Secondary, Visual Showcase):
- Handle: @deadpangame
- Frequency: 2-3 posts per week
- Content Types:
  - Key art and screenshots (carousel posts)
  - Behind-the-scenes dev photos (corkboard with real setlists, desk setup)
  - Quote graphics ("Funny isn't universal. Funny is situational.")

---

### Content Calendar (Sample Month)

**Week 1**:
- **Monday (Twitter)**: "The Bit Builder is live. Here's how joke construction works. [GIF]"
- **Wednesday (Reddit)**: Devlog post on /r/indiegaming: "How We Built a Crowd Engine That Heckles You"
- **Friday (Twitter)**: "What's your comedy voice? Are you Observational or Absurdist? Clean or Dark? The game tracks this and gates your career accordingly."

**Week 2**:
- **Monday (Discord)**: Announcement: "New venue reveal this week. Guess which club it is. First correct answer gets early beta access."
- **Wednesday (Twitter)**: Venue reveal: "The Comedy Store. 200-seat room. Industry scouts in the back. Are you ready?"
- **Friday (Instagram)**: Carousel post: 5 screenshots of The Comedy Store venue (stage, green room, crowd, flyer)

**Week 3**:
- **Monday (Twitter)**: "Fun fact: The Laugh Graph uses the same waveform visualization as audio production software. Because a great set SOUNDS like music."
- **Wednesday (Reddit)**: AMA on /r/standup: "I'm making a stand-up comedy sim and I want to get it right. What should I know?"
- **Friday (TikTok)**: 15-second video: "Building a joke in real time. Watch the Quality score change as I add components. [Speed-run of Bit Builder]"

**Week 4**:
- **Monday (Twitter)**: Community prompt: "What's your worst bombing story? Tag #DeadpanGame. Top 5 become in-game Premise cards."
- **Wednesday (Discord)**: Winners announced. "Congratulations to @user1, @user2... your pain is now immortalized as joke components."
- **Friday (Twitter)**: "One week until the Steam demo drops. Wishlist now: [link]"

### Social Media Voice Guide

DEADPAN's social media voice is HYPE's voice: energetic, hook-driven, audience-focused. But also warm, self-aware, and respectful of comedy.

**Do**:
- Lead with hooks ("What's the GIF?" — every post should have a scroll-stop visual or sentence)
- Engage in comments (reply to everyone who asks a question or shares a story)
- Use humor, but not at the expense of the game's sincerity (comedy is serious business)
- Share dev insights that make the audience feel like insiders
- Celebrate the community (retweet fan art, highlight Discord conversations, thank people who wishlist)

**Don't**:
- Over-post (quality > quantity; one great post per day beats five mediocre ones)
- Be salesy (nobody likes "BUY NOW" spam; focus on "here's why this is cool")
- Ignore negative feedback (if someone says "this looks like a spreadsheet simulator," engage: "What would make it feel more like joke writing?")
- Use memes that don't fit the tone (DEADPAN is warm and specific, not ironic and detached)

---

## 6. PRESS OUTREACH STRATEGY

Press coverage is the credibility multiplier. A single article in PC Gamer is worth 10,000 wishlists. A feature in IGN is worth 50,000. But press is earned, not bought.

### Press Kit Contents (Digital + Always Updated)

### Press Pitch Templates

Press pitches must be PERSONALIZED. No mass emails. Research the outlet, reference a recent article they published, and explain why DEADPAN fits their audience.

**Template 1: Exclusive First Look**

Subject: "DEADPAN — Stand-Up Comedy Tycoon (Exclusive First Look?)"

Body:
"Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], and I'm making DEADPAN — a stand-up comedy tycoon game where you build jokes from modular components, perform them to AI audiences that can heckle you, and manage a career from open mics to Netflix specials.

I loved your recent piece on [specific article they wrote]. It made me think DEADPAN would resonate with your audience — it's a tycoon game in a totally untapped setting (stand-up comedy), with a mechanical hook (modular joke construction) that hasn't been done before.

The elevator pitch: Game Dev Tycoon meets the Comedy Store.

I'm offering an exclusive first look for [Outlet Name] if you're interested. I have a playable build, the announcement trailer, key art, and a full press kit ready to go.

Let me know if this sounds like something worth covering.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Link to Press Kit]"

---

**Template 2: Review Code Offer**

Subject: "DEADPAN Review Code — Stand-Up Comedy Sim Launching [Date]"

Body:
"Hi [Name],

DEADPAN launches on Steam [Date]. It's a stand-up comedy tycoon game where you build jokes, perform them to AI audiences, and manage a career from open mics to empire.

I'm reaching out because I think it would be a great fit for [Outlet Name]'s coverage. The game has:
- A modular joke construction system (Premise + Setup + Misdirection + Punchline)
- Reactive AI audiences (nine archetypes, real-time reactions, heckling, viral moments)
- A full career simulation (six tiers, 40+ venues, Voice Identity gating)

Would you be interested in a review code? Embargo lifts on [Launch Day].

Press kit: [Link]
Steam page: [Link]

Thanks for considering,
[Your Name]"

---

**Template 3: Post-Launch "We Hit a Milestone" Pitch**

Subject: "DEADPAN Sold 10K Copies in Week One — Here's Why"

Body:
"Hi [Name],

Quick update: DEADPAN (the stand-up comedy tycoon game) sold 10,000 copies in its first week on Steam. The response has been overwhelming — "Very Positive" reviews, 50+ Twitch streams, and a community that's already building and sharing joke setlists.

I think there's a story here about WHY a stand-up comedy sim resonated when nobody's made this game before. The short answer: there's a massive crossover audience (comedy fans + tycoon players) that's been completely underserved.

Would [Outlet Name] be interested in a post-mortem feature? I'm happy to share sales data, community stories, and insights into what worked (and what didn't).

Let me know.

Best,
[Your Name]"

---

## 7. COMMUNITY BUILDING STRATEGY

A strong community is the difference between a game that sells 5K copies and a game that sells 50K. Community turns buyers into evangelists.

### Discord: The Green Room

**Why Discord**: It's where indie game communities live. It's real-time. It's intimate. It's where the most engaged players congregate.

**Server Structure**:

**INFORMATION**
- #announcements (dev updates, patch notes, launch info)
- #rules (code of conduct)
- #faq (common questions)

**COMMUNITY**
- #general (open chat)
- #introductions (new members say hi)
- #setlist-showcase (players share their best joke combos and Laugh Graph results)
- #comedy-talk (discuss real stand-up, Netflix specials, favorite comedians)
- #fan-art (community creations)

**GAME DISCUSSION**
- #strategy (tips, builds, Voice Identity optimization)
- #feedback (bug reports, feature requests)
- #modding (if modding support is added post-launch)

**DEV PRESENCE**
- #dev-chat (weekly dev Q&A, behind-the-scenes)
- #playtesting (closed channel for beta testers)

**VOICE CHANNELS**
- General Voice
- Dev Office Hours (weekly 1-hour session where the dev hangs out and chats)

**Moderation**:
- Hire 2-3 community moderators (volunteers from the early community, compensated with free game keys + merch)
- Rules: No toxicity, no spam, no spoilers without tags, respect comedy (no punching down)

**Growth Strategy**:
- Invite link in every social media post, press kit, and Steam page
- Exclusive perks for Discord members (early access to patch notes, dev polls on new features, sneak peeks)
- Monthly events (setlist-building contest, Voice Identity quiz results showcase, "Comedy Night" where members share real stories)

**Target Growth**:
- Month -6: 100 members (early fans)
- Month -3: 500 members (demo release bump)
- Launch: 2,000 members
- Month +3: 5,000 members

---

### Reddit Community Strategy

**Don't Create a Subreddit** (yet). The audience is too small pre-launch. Instead, build presence in EXISTING subreddits:
- /r/tycoon (post devlogs, engage in comments)
- /r/indiegaming (post updates, share GIFs)
- /r/gamedev (share technical insights: "How We Built the Crowd Engine")
- /r/standup (engage authentically: "I'm making a stand-up sim — what should I get right?")

**When to Create /r/DeadpanGame**: When the Discord hits 2,000 members and there's organic demand for a subreddit. Reddit is for asynchronous discussion; Discord is for real-time community. Both serve different purposes, but don't split the community too early.

---

### Community Events (Post-Launch)

**Event 1: The Best Setlist Contest (Month +1)**

- Players submit their best 10-joke setlist (screenshot + text description)
- Voting in Discord (emoji reactions)
- Winner gets: in-game recognition (their setlist becomes a "legendary set" easter egg in the game), physical merch (DEADPAN t-shirt), $50 Steam gift card

**Event 2: Comedy Voice Quiz (Month +2)**

- Create a 5-question personality quiz: "What's Your Comedy Voice?"
- Questions like: "When a joke bombs, do you: A) Double down, B) Pivot immediately, C) Make the bomb part of the joke?"
- Results: "You're a Warm Observationalist" or "You're a Dark Absurdist" (generates a shareable graphic with Voice Identity spectrum)
- Share results on Twitter with #DeadpanGame

**Event 3: Fan-Generated Premise Cards (Month +3)**

- "Submit your best one-liner observation (the setup for a Premise card). Top 10 get added to the game in the next update."
- Community votes on Discord
- Winners see their joke Premise in the game (credited with their username or real name if they prefer)

## 8. TRAILER SCRIPT (60-Second Announcement Trailer)

The trailer is the scroll-stop moment for people who don't read. Every frame, every word, every sound is a marketing decision.

---

**[FADE IN FROM BLACK]**

**[0:00-0:03]**
- Visual: Empty stage. Brick wall. Single spotlight fades up, illuminating a microphone stand.
- Audio: Silence. Then distant crowd murmur (low, ominous).
- Text on screen (white text, Caveat font): *"You bombed last night."*

---

**[0:03-0:05]**
- Visual: Cut to close-up of a napkin on a table. Handwritten setlist. Coffee stain in the corner.
- Audio: Pen scratching on paper.
- Text on screen: *"Do you still have it?"*

---

**[0:05-0:10]**
- Visual: The Bit Builder. Hands (first-person POV) drag joke component cards onto a corkboard.
  - Card 1: "Premise: Dating Apps"
  - Card 2: "Setup: I tried a dating app for comedians..."
  - Card 3: "Punchline: Turns out nobody swipes right on emotional damage."
- Cards snap together with a satisfying click. A Quality score appears (72/100, green).
- Audio: Card snap sound (tactile, satisfying). Faint piano melody begins (main theme).
- Text on screen: *"Build jokes from modular components."*

---

**[0:10-0:15]**
- Visual: Cut to performance view. Stage. Spotlight. Audience visible in shadow (abstract circle heads).
- The player's joke text appears on screen in handwritten font: *"Setup: I tried a dating app for comedians..."*
- Audio: The joke is READ ALOUD by a neutral voice (not performed, just read — this keeps the focus on the text and the system, not on voice acting quality).
- The audience reacts: some laugh (heads tilt back), some don't (heads tilt down).
- The Laugh Graph at the bottom of the screen spikes in Spotlight Gold.
- Text on screen: *"Perform them to living audiences."*

---

**[0:15-0:20]**
- Visual: Rapid cuts:
  1. Dive bar open mic (8 people, sticky floor, clip light)
  2. Comedy club (brick wall, two-drink minimum sign, 50-person crowd)
  3. Theater (velvet curtain, 500 seats, industry scouts in the back)
- Audio: Laughter samples layered, building in intensity. Piano melody swells.
- Text on screen: *"Every audience is different."*

---

**[0:20-0:25]**
- Visual: Post-set Laugh Graph analysis screen. The waveform shows peaks and valleys. Tooltip hovers over a valley: "Joke #3: Bombed. Comedy Nerds loved it. Date Night Couples did not."
- Audio: Subtle "realization" sound cue (soft chime).
- Text on screen: *"Learn what works. Iterate."*

---

**[0:25-0:30]**
- Visual: Career progression montage:
  1. Open mic flyer: "The Creek — Tuesday Night Open Mic"
  2. Comedy club flyer: "The Comedy Store — Saturday Headliner"
  3. Theater marquee: "SOLD OUT"
  4. Special taping: Large theater, cameras, HBO logo on screen
- Audio: Piano + beat drop (uplifting, triumphant).
- Text on screen: *"Open mic to empire."*

---

**[0:30-0:35]**
- Visual: The Scene. Phone screen showing text messages:
  - Agent: "Great set last night. We have offers."
  - Rival comic: "Heard you killed. Let's tour together?"
  - Booker: "You're ready for the big room."
- Audio: Text notification sounds (ding, ding, ding).
- Text on screen: *"Navigate the comedy world."*

---

**[0:35-0:40]**
- Visual: Voice Identity screen. Radar chart showing five axes: Observational/Absurdist, Clean/Dark, Political/Personal, Cerebral/Physical, Warm/Confrontational.
- A character profile overlay: "You are a Dark Observationalist. Authenticity: 78%."
- Audio: Piano melody continues.
- Text on screen: *"Choose your voice. Live with it."*

---

**[0:40-0:45]**
- Visual: Montage of success moments:
  1. Laugh Graph eruption (waveform spike fills the screen in Spotlight Gold)
  2. Standing ovation (audience on their feet, circle heads raised)
  3. REP unlock notification: "You are now a HEADLINER."
  4. Special taping stage (empty, waiting)
- Audio: Music swells to climax.
- Text on screen: *"Build a career. Find your voice."*

---

**[0:45-0:50]**
- Visual: Return to the microphone stand. Spotlight still on. But now the stage looks different — it's the special taping venue. The audience is packed. The room is silent, waiting.
- The mic stand alone, center-frame.
- Audio: Crowd murmur fades. Silence. Just the piano.
- Text on screen: *"The mic is the loneliest place on earth."*

---

**[0:50-0:55]**
- Visual: Black screen.
- Text on screen (large, centered):
  - "DEADPAN"
  - "Stand-Up Comedy Empire Simulation"
  - "Wishlist Now on Steam"
- Audio: Piano resolves. Final note holds.

---

**[0:55-0:60]**
- Visual: Steam logo. Wishlist button.
- Text on screen: "Coming 2026"
- Audio: Fade to silence.

---

**[FADE TO BLACK]**

---

**Trailer Notes**:
- All footage is in-game (no pre-rendered cinematics).
- Text overlays use Caveat (handwritten) for personality, Inter (clean) for clarity.
- Color grading matches the game: warm golds and reds, deep blacks, high contrast.
- The joke text is read aloud in a neutral voice to demonstrate the system, but performance is IMPLIED, not shown (this avoids the "is the voice acting good?" distraction).
- Music is the main theme (melancholic piano + uplifting swell). No voiceover. The visuals and text carry the narrative.

---

## 9. INFLUENCER AND COMEDIAN PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

This is the nuclear option. If a single working comedian tweets "this game gets it," the conversion rate will be unlike anything in the tycoon genre.

### Strategy: Authenticity Over Reach

DO NOT reach out to celebrity comedians cold. They get a thousand pitches a day. Start small and authentic.

### Tier 1: Working Comedians (10K-100K Twitter Followers)

**Targets** (comedians who are terminally online, game-aware, and likely to engage):
- **Bo Burnham** (if reachable — he's a filmmaker and comedian who thinks about systems and craft)
- **Jaboukie Young-White** (comedian, very online, gaming references in his work)
- **Aparna Nancherla** (comedian, thoughtful about the craft, active on Twitter)
- **Sam Morril** (working comedian, podcast host, accessible)
- **Taylor Tomlinson** (working comedian, young audience, relatable brand)
- **Mark Normand** (working comedian, comedy nerd, podcast regular)
- **Joe Pera** (comedian, thoughtful, specific voice)
- **Megan Gailey** (comedian, online presence, accessible)

**Pitch Template**:

Subject: "DEADPAN — A Stand-Up Comedy Sim (Would Love Your Thoughts)"

Body:
"Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], and I'm making a video game about stand-up comedy. Not a party game or a rhythm game — a real simulation where you build jokes from components (Premise, Setup, Misdirection, Punchline), perform them to AI audiences, and manage a career from open mics to specials.

I'm reaching out because I want to get it RIGHT. I've studied joke theory, watched hundreds of hours of specials, and talked to working comedians. But I'd love your input.

Would you be open to trying an early build and giving feedback? No obligations, no sponsorship pitch — I just want to make sure the game respects the craft.

Here's a 60-second trailer: [Link]

Thanks for considering,
[Your Name]
[Link to Press Kit]"

**Expected Response Rate**: 10-20%. Even one comedian engaging is a win.

**What to Do If They Say Yes**:
- Send them a Steam key for the full game (or beta build if pre-launch)
- Ask for a 15-minute Zoom call to talk about what works and what doesn't
- If they love it, ask if they'd be comfortable tweeting about it (DO NOT DEMAND THIS — let it happen organically)

**What to Do If They Tweet About It**:
- Retweet immediately with gratitude ("This means everything. Thank you.")
- Use the tweet in ALL marketing materials ("'This game gets it.' — [Comedian Name]")
- Add their quote to the Steam page (with permission)

---

### Tier 2: Comedy Podcasters (500K+ Listeners)

**Targets**:
- **Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend** (reach out to producers, not Conan directly)
- **Kill Tony** (live podcast with comedian guests — pitch the game as a topic of discussion)
- **WTF with Marc Maron** (harder to reach, but worth trying via producers)
- **The Joe Rogan Experience** (if there's a comedy-focused episode — this is a moonshot)
- **The Comedy Store Podcast** (directly relevant to the game's title comp)
- **Your Mom's House** (Tom Segura and Christina P. — big audience, game-aware)
- **Bad Friends** (Bobby Lee and Andrew Santino — comedy + gaming crossover)

**Pitch Template**:

Subject: "DEADPAN — Stand-Up Comedy Sim (Sponsorship or Topic?)"

Body:
"Hi [Podcast Producer Name],

I'm [Your Name], and I'm launching a stand-up comedy simulation game called DEADPAN. It's a tycoon game where you build jokes, perform them to AI audiences, and manage a career from open mics to Netflix specials.

I think [Podcast Name]'s audience would love this — comedy fans who appreciate the craft.

Would [Podcast Name] be open to:
- A 30-second sponsorship read (I can provide copy or you can improvise)
- OR discussing the game as a topic (I can send a copy to the hosts)

I have a marketing budget for podcast sponsorships. Let me know rates and availability.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
[Link to Trailer]"

**Budget**: Podcast ad buys range from $500-$5,000 per episode depending on reach. Allocate $5,000-$10,000 for 2-4 podcast sponsorships during launch month.

**Expected ROI**: 1,000-5,000 Steam wishlists per podcast ad (if the audience is a good fit).

---

### Tier 3: Comedy YouTube Channels (100K+ Subs)

**Targets**:
- **Funhaus** (gaming + comedy)
- **Jarvis Johnson** (comedian + YouTuber)
- **Drew Gooden** (comedian + commentary)
- **Kurtis Conner** (comedian + commentary)
- **Gus Johnson** (comedian + sketch creator)

**Pitch**: Similar to Tier 1 comedians — offer a free key, ask for honest coverage, let them create content if they're interested.

---

## 12. RISK MITIGATION (What Could Go Wrong and How to Fix It)

Marketing is optimism backed by paranoia. Here's what could go wrong and the contingency plans.

### Risk 1: The Trailer Doesn't Land

**Symptom**: Low engagement on the announcement trailer (sub-1,000 views in week one, low comments/likes).

**Diagnosis**: The hook isn't clear, or the visuals don't communicate the gameplay.

**Fix**:
- A/B test a second trailer (15-second version focused ONLY on the Bit Builder GIF — the scroll-stop moment)
- Re-cut the 60-second trailer with different text overlays ("Build jokes" → "Craft jokes like a comedian")
- Promote the GIF separately from the trailer (the GIF might work better on Twitter than the full video)

---

### Risk 2: Wishlists Stall

**Symptom**: Wishlist velocity drops to <100/week during devlog phase.

**Diagnosis**: Audience fatigue (too many devlog posts) or insufficient virality (the content isn't being shared).

**Fix**:
- Shift from "dev update" posts to "community engagement" posts (run polls, ask questions, share user stories)
- Post more GIFs and fewer text updates (visual > textual on social media)
- Run a giveaway (free Steam keys for 10 people who wishlist and retweet)

---

### Risk 3: Press Ignores the Pitch

**Symptom**: Zero responses from Tier 1 press outlets.

**Diagnosis**: The pitch is lost in their inbox, or the hook isn't compelling to them.

**Fix**:
- Shift focus to Tier 2 and Tier 3 outlets (indie-focused press is more responsive)
- Reach out to individual journalists on Twitter (don't DM cold, but reply to their tweets with genuine engagement first)
- Offer an exclusive angle ("The First Comedy Sim: Why No One's Made This Game Before" as a think-piece pitch to The Atlantic or Polygon)

---

### Risk 4: Launch Day Sales Are Below Target

**Symptom**: 500 units sold on day one (expected: 2,000).

**Diagnosis**: Either the wishlist-to-sale conversion failed, or the game's messaging doesn't match player expectations.

**Fix**:
- Check Steam reviews immediately (are people complaining about something specific?)
- If reviews are positive but sales are low, the issue is AWARENESS, not QUALITY. Double down on influencer outreach post-launch (send 50 more keys to smaller YouTubers).
- If reviews are negative, the issue is PRODUCT. Fix critical bugs within 48 hours and communicate transparently ("We hear you. Patch incoming.").

---

### Risk 5: Negative Reviews Due to Mismatched Expectations

**Symptom**: "This isn't what I thought it would be" reviews. Rating drops to "Mixed."

**Diagnosis**: The marketing oversold or undersold a feature.

**Fix**:
- Update the Steam page copy to clarify what the game IS and ISN'T ("This is a tycoon/management sim, not a rhythm game or party game")
- Respond to reviews directly with empathy ("Thanks for the feedback. Here's what we're working on.")
- Post a "What DEADPAN Is (and Isn't)" devlog on Steam and Reddit

---

### Risk 6: Comedian Partnership Backfires

**Symptom**: A comedian tweets about the game negatively ("This doesn't understand comedy at all").

**Diagnosis**: The game misrepresented the craft, or the comedian had expectations the game didn't meet.

**Fix**:
- Respond publicly with humility ("You're right. Here's what we got wrong and how we're fixing it.")
- Do NOT get defensive. Comedians have massive followings and the moral high ground if the game disrespects the craft.
- Use the feedback to improve the game (if they're right, implement changes and credit them in the patch notes)

---

## 13. POST-LAUNCH MARKETING (Months 1-12)

Launch is not the finish line. It's the starting gun. Post-launch marketing is about RETENTION, WORD-OF-MOUTH, and LONG-TAIL SALES.

### Month 1-3: The Honeymoon Phase

**Goals**:
- Maintain momentum (weekly content updates, community events)
- Fix critical bugs (players forgive bugs if they're fixed fast)
- Generate UGC (user-generated content becomes free marketing)

**Tactics**:
- Weekly devlog posts (patch notes, behind-the-scenes, roadmap updates)
- Community events (setlist contest, comedy voice quiz)
- Engage with every streamer and YouTuber who covers the game (retweet, share, thank them)

---

### Month 4-6: The Content Drop

**Goal**: Re-engage lapsed players and attract new ones.

**Tactics**:
- Release a free content update (10 new joke components, 2 new venues, 1 new AI comedian)
- Announce the update across all channels ("DEADPAN: The Green Room Update is live. Free for all players.")
- Coordinate with influencers (send them the update early, ask for coverage)

---

### Month 7-12: The Long Tail

**Goal**: Sustain sales through seasonal events and sales.

**Tactics**:
- Participate in Steam seasonal sales (Summer Sale, Winter Sale) with 20-30% discount
- Release DLC or expansion (optional, only if there's demand: "The International Circuit" — new cities, new venues, new cultural comedy styles)
- Run a "Year in Review" post (share stats: X jokes built, Y sets performed, Z players reached Empire tier)

---

## 14. BUDGET ALLOCATION (Estimated $25,000 Marketing Budget)

Marketing costs money. Here's how to spend $25,000 to maximize reach and conversion.

| Category | Allocation | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| **Key Art and Trailer Production** | $5,000 | Professional artist for key art, video editor for trailer |
| **Press Kit and Website** | $2,000 | Press kit design, domain + hosting |
| **Podcast Ad Buys** | $8,000 | 2-4 comedy podcast sponsorships ($2,000-$4,000 each) |
| **Influencer Outreach (Paid)** | $5,000 | Optional: pay 5-10 micro-influencers ($500 each) for guaranteed coverage |
| **Community Events and Prizes** | $2,000 | Setlist contest prizes, merch for giveaways |
| **Paid Social Ads (Experimental)** | $2,000 | Facebook/Instagram ads targeting tycoon game players (test and iterate) |
| **Miscellaneous** | $1,000 | Unexpected costs, last-minute assets |

**Total**: $25,000

**Alternative Low-Budget Plan ($5,000)**:
- Skip podcast ads and paid influencers
- Focus on organic social media, Reddit, and Discord
- DIY key art and trailer (Canva + iMovie/DaVinci Resolve)
- Allocate $2,000 to community events and $3,000 to festival submissions and press kit production

## 15. FINAL THOUGHTS FROM HYPE

Marketing is not about shouting the loudest. It's about finding the people who NEED this game and showing them it exists.

DEADPAN has three unfair advantages:

1. **Blue Ocean Setting**: Nobody's made a stand-up comedy tycoon game. The novelty alone will generate press coverage and social media buzz.

2. **Crossover Audience**: Tycoon players + comedy fans is a Venn diagram with MASSIVE overlap that's never been served. The market is there. We just have to reach it.

3. **Mechanical Hook**: "A game where you build jokes and perform them to AI audiences that can heckle you." That sentence is a scroll-stop. It's a headline. It's a tweet that gets 10,000 retweets.

The marketing plan is aggressive but grounded. Start building the audience on day one. The Bit Builder GIF is the single most important asset — it's the game in five seconds. The Steam page is the conversion engine — it must be flawless. The community (Discord, Reddit, Twitter) is the flywheel — engaged players become evangelists.

Launch is not the finish line. It's the starting gun. Post-launch, the game markets itself through word-of-mouth, UGC, and streamer coverage. But only if the foundation is solid.

What's the hook? "Build jokes. Bomb sets. Become a legend."

What's the GIF? Cards snapping together → spotlight hitting the stage → Laugh Graph spiking.

What's the audience? Tycoon players who want novelty + comedy fans who want craft.

What's the timeline? Announce at Month -6. Demo at Month -3. Launch with 30,000 wishlists and 20 influencer videos coordinated.

What's the goal? 5,000 units sold in week one. 25,000 units sold in year one. "Very Positive" reviews. An active community that generates setlists, shares stories, and keeps the game alive long after launch.

Now go make the GIF. Everything else follows from that.

Show the GAME, not the features. Make people FEEL the spotlight. Make them WANT to stand in front of a crowd and find out if they still have it.

That's the marketing plan.
