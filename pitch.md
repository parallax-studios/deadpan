# DEADPAN — Game Pitch Document

**Game Dev Tycoon meets the Comedy Store**

*A stand-up comedy empire simulation where joke construction is a craft system, audiences are living ecosystems, and the mic is the loneliest place on earth.*

---

## THE HOOK

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Elevator Pitch

**Build a comedy empire from open-mic nobody to HBO special — where every joke you write is a hand-crafted mechanism of setup, misdirection, and punchline, and every audience is an AI ecosystem that laughs, heckles, walks out, or makes you go viral.**

### Scroll-Stop Line

> "I spent forty minutes writing a bit about airport security. Killed at the Brooklyn open mic. Bombed at the college show. Got a standing ovation when I reworked the callback at 2 AM in a dive bar in Tulsa. This is the best comedy sim ever made because it understands that funny isn't universal — funny is *situational*."

### The "Oh, That's Cool" Moment

Picture this: The player drags joke cards onto a setlist napkin — SETUP, MISDIRECTION, PUNCHLINE — locking them together like puzzle pieces. They step up to the brick wall. The spotlight hits. The room is a Tuesday night open mic at a bar in Queens — fifteen people, half of them other comedians waiting for their slot, two bachelorette party stragglers, one guy on his phone. The player delivers the first bit. The Laugh Meter ripples — a few chuckles, the comedians nod. Second bit lands harder. The bachelorette table is paying attention now. Third bit — the CALLBACK to the opener, reworked with a dark twist — and the room *cracks*. The phone guy looks up. The Laugh Meter spikes into ROLLING territory. A notification pops: "AUDIENCE MEMBER @ComedyNerd47 is live-tweeting your set."

That moment — a room turning from indifference to electricity — is a 5-second GIF that sells the game to every person who's ever watched a Netflix special and thought, "I wonder what that journey looks like."

## THE CORE

*[REED speaks]*

### Core Loop

**30-second loop**: The Joke Workshop. Construct individual jokes using the **Bit Builder** — a modular card system where you select a PREMISE (the observation), attach a SETUP (the framing), choose a MISDIRECTION (where the audience thinks you're going), and snap on a PUNCHLINE (the actual destination). Each component has stats: Cleverness, Relatability, Edge, Absurdity, Physicality. The combination creates a joke with a Humor Profile — a fingerprint that determines which audiences will connect with it.

**5-minute loop**: The Set. Arrange 5-12 jokes into a setlist, considering FLOW (do the bits build? does the energy arc?), CALLBACKS (referencing earlier material multiplies laughs), and CLOSER SELECTION (your last bit determines how the audience remembers you). Step on stage. Perform. The audience reacts in real time. Read the room. You have limited **PIVOT POINTS** — moments mid-set where you can swap an upcoming bit for something from your back-pocket material based on how the crowd is trending. After the set: review your Laugh Graph, collect REP (reputation currency), and unlock new opportunities.

**Session loop (30-60 minutes)**: The Career Week. Book gigs from your available venues. Write new material in your apartment. Workshop bits at open mics (low-stakes testing). Perform at booked shows (high-stakes, high-reward). Manage relationships with club bookers, agents, and rival comedians. Spend REP to unlock new tiers of the comedy world — from open mics to club regular spots to headlining to television to specials. Each tier changes the stakes, the audience composition, and what "success" means.

### Core Mechanics

1. **Bit Builder (Joke Construction System)**: The mechanical heart. Jokes are assembled from modular components — Premise, Setup, Misdirection, Punchline, and optional Tag (extra punchline) and Callback (reference to earlier material). Each component is a card with stats across five axes: Cleverness, Relatability, Edge, Absurdity, and Physicality. Component cards are discovered through Life Events (things that happen to you in the simulation), Cultural Moments (trending topics in the game world), Workshops (collaborative sessions with other comedians), and Theft (yes, you can steal — but there are consequences). The genius is in the combinations: a high-Cleverness Setup paired with a high-Absurdity Punchline creates a different joke *type* than a high-Relatability Setup with a high-Edge Punchline. Thousands of viable combinations. The system is simple to use, impossible to master.

2. **The Crowd Engine (Audience AI)**: Every audience is a composition of audience member archetypes — Comedy Nerds, Date Night Couples, Bachelor Parties, College Students, Industry Scouts, Drunk Hecklers, Fellow Comedians, Late-Night Bookers, Podcast Listeners. Each archetype has preferences across the five humor axes, a Patience stat (how long before they disengage), a Volatility stat (how quickly they swing from laughter to heckling), and a Viral Potential stat (likelihood of recording/sharing). The venue determines the crowd composition. A Tuesday open mic at a dive bar is 60% Fellow Comedians, 20% Regulars, 20% Random Walk-ins. A Saturday headliner at The Comedy Store is 30% Comedy Nerds, 25% Date Night, 20% Industry, 15% Tourists, 10% Drunk Hecklers. The audience reacts collectively AND individually — you can lose one table while winning another, and the energy of each group bleeds into the others.

3. **The Laugh Graph (Performance Feedback System)**: During and after every set, a real-time visualization shows audience engagement as a waveform. Peaks are laughs. Valleys are silence. Spikes are ERUPTIONS (huge laughs that shift the room's energy state). Flatlines are death. The graph becomes your primary diagnostic tool — you can see exactly which bit landed, which transition lost them, and where the callback connected. Post-set analysis breaks down performance by joke, by audience segment, and by timing. This is how you iterate: take the graph, go back to the Bit Builder, adjust, and try again.

4. **Voice Identity System**: As you write and perform material, the game tracks your comedic identity across five spectra: Observational vs. Absurdist, Clean vs. Dark, Political vs. Personal, Cerebral vs. Physical, Warm vs. Confrontational. Your position on these spectra determines your **Comedy Voice** — a unique profile that attracts specific fan demographics, opens certain career paths, and closes others. A Warm/Observational/Clean comic gets the sitcom deal. A Dark/Political/Confrontational comic gets the cult following and the podcast empire. You can shift your voice deliberately, but audiences notice — and the game tracks Authenticity. Drift too far from your established voice and you lose your core fans before building new ones. This is the central strategic tension: stay true or go broad?

5. **The Scene (Rival and Collaborator AI)**: The comedy world is populated with 15-20 AI comedians, each with their own Voice Identity, career trajectory, material library, and relationship with you. They compete for the same gig slots. They develop followings that overlap with yours. They can become collaborators — writing partners, podcast co-hosts, touring buddies who warm up your crowds. Or they become rivals — stealing your bits (mechanically: if an AI comic performs a joke with a similar Humor Profile before you do it on a bigger stage, you lose priority on it), undercutting your bookings, or blowing up and making your niche feel small. The scene is alive. Comics rise, burn out, sell out, come back. The relationships are the connective tissue of the career simulation.

### What Mastery Looks Like

A beginner slaps joke components together randomly, performs at whatever venue is available, and wonders why their bits about airline food bomb at a college show. They treat the Bit Builder like a slot machine.

An expert reads the venue's crowd composition before writing a single joke. They craft setlists with deliberate energy arcs — opening with high-Relatability material to win the room, escalating through their signature voice, planting setup lines for callbacks three bits later, and closing with their strongest material tuned to the specific audience. They use Pivot Points strategically, reading the Laugh Graph in real time and swapping bits when they feel a segment disengaging. They manage their Voice Identity deliberately — taking calculated risks to expand their range without alienating their base. They play the Scene like a chess board: collaborating with comics whose audiences complement theirs, avoiding rivalry with comics who share their lane, and timing their career moves (the Netflix special, the late-night set, the podcast launch) to maximize cultural moment.

The depth ceiling is enormous. At hour 1, you're learning that audiences are different. At hour 20, you're reading crowd composition reports and pre-building setlists for specific venues. At hour 100, you're managing a comedy empire while maintaining the creative spark that got you here — and that tension never stops being interesting.

### Unique Mechanic

**The Bit Builder** — joke construction as a modular craft system. Other tycoon games abstract creative work into a single "quality" stat or a progress bar. Deadpan makes you *build the joke*. You feel the difference between a tight five and a rambling seven. You understand why the callback killed and the tag flopped. The joke isn't a black box — it's a machine you built with your hands, and when it works, the satisfaction is visceral. No other simulation game has made the creative product itself a deep, iterable mechanical system.

## THE HEART

*[NOVA speaks]*

### Theme

**Beneath the punchlines, this game is about the cost of being seen.**

Comedy is the art of exposing yourself and calling it entertainment. Every joke is a confession disguised as a performance. The comic stands in a spotlight — literally the most visible person in any room — and turns their pain, their observations, their weird broken way of seeing the world into something that makes strangers laugh. That transaction — vulnerability exchanged for validation — is the engine of every career in this game.

Deadpan asks: what happens when the thing that makes you special is the thing the market wants to sand down? What happens when authenticity becomes a brand? When your worst night becomes your best material? When the audience loves the version of you that you perform, and you can't remember which version is real?

This is a game about the distance between who you are on stage and who you are in the green room. And the slow, terrifying discovery that the distance is shrinking.

### The World

The world of Deadpan is the American comedy circuit, rendered with the specificity of someone who has spent too many nights in rooms that smell like beer and broken dreams. It is a world of brick walls and two-drink minimums, of green rooms with mirrors rimmed by dead bulbs, of late-night diners where comics dissect each other's sets over cold coffee. The geography is real: you start in a specific city — New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, or Austin — and each has its own scene, its own rooms, its own audiences, its own comedy culture.

The wound of this world is *impermanence*. A joke kills tonight and dies tomorrow. A hot comic is forgotten in eighteen months. The algorithm giveth and the algorithm taketh away. The comedy world runs on a currency of attention, and attention is the most volatile resource on earth. Everyone in this world is chasing a moment that, by its nature, cannot last. The green room knows this. The brick wall knows this. The two-drink minimum exists because the audience needs courage too.

The aesthetic is warm and gritty and specific. `#1A1A2E` midnight blue-black for the rooms. `#E8D44D` spotlight gold cutting through haze. `#C0392B` brick red for the walls that have heard ten thousand punchlines. `#F5F0E1` for the napkins covered in scrawled setlists. `#2ECC71` for the neon OPEN sign buzzing in the window. `#8E44AD` for the purple velvet curtain at the big rooms — The Comedy Store, The Cellar, The Stand. The UI lives on napkins, bar tabs, phone screens, and comedy club flyers. Every interface element feels like something you'd find in a comic's pocket at 1 AM.

### Player's Emotional Arc

**The Open Mic Phase**: Terror and exhilaration. The first time you step up and a joke lands — even to a half-empty room — is electric. The first time you bomb is devastating. You feel small. The world is enormous and indifferent. But there's a voice in the back of your head: *I can do this. I know I can do this.*

**The Grind Phase**: Pride and exhaustion. You're getting regular spots. You have a voice. The bits are getting tighter. But the grind is relentless — you're performing five nights a week, writing every morning, and the pay is nothing. You watch AI comics you came up with start to pass you. The question shifts from "can I do this?" to "is this worth doing?"

**The Breakout Phase**: Euphoria and vertigo. Something catches. A clip goes viral. An agent calls. A late-night booker wants you. The world that ignored you suddenly has opinions about you. The audiences get bigger. The stakes get higher. You feel the pressure to repeat the thing that worked — and the creative restlessness that made you good in the first place starts pulling you somewhere new.

**The Empire Phase**: Power and emptiness. You have the special. You have the tour. You have the podcast and the development deal. You can sell out theaters. And somewhere in the green room of a 3,000-seat venue, staring at a setlist on a napkin, you feel the same thing you felt at that first open mic: *Am I funny? Or am I just famous?*

**The full arc**: The player discovers that the game's central tension — authenticity vs. success — has no clean resolution. The most emotionally satisfying path is not the one that maximizes metrics. It's the one that feels *true*.

### The Story Hook

**You bombed last night.**

That's where the game starts. Not at the beginning of a career — in the middle of a crisis. You had a set at a mid-level club and you ate it. Hard. The room went cold. A heckler got the biggest laugh of the night. Your agent hasn't called back.

Now you're sitting in your apartment with a notebook and a question: *Do I still have it?*

The game opens in the wreckage of confidence. Everything you do from this point is an answer to that question. Every joke you write is proof. Every set is a test. The career simulation is the structure, but the story is about *rebuilding belief in yourself* — and then deciding what to do with that belief once it comes back.

The narrative question that pulls the player forward: **Is the best version of my comedy the version the world wants, or the version I need to make?**

## THE MARKET

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Target Audience

**Primary**: Simulation and tycoon game players aged 20-40. They've sunk hundreds of hours into Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, Software Inc., and Music Inc. They love systems that model creative industries. They're on r/tycoon, r/simulation, and r/BaseBuildingGames. They want a tycoon game in a setting they've never seen before.

**Secondary**: Comedy fans and podcast listeners aged 18-35. They watch Netflix specials weekly, listen to comedy podcasts (Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend, Kill Tony, The Comedy Store docuseries), and follow comedians on social media. They've never played a tycoon game, but a game about *comedy* pulls them in. They're on r/standup, r/Comedy, Twitter comedy communities, and TikTok comedy clips.

**Tertiary**: Creative professionals and aspiring comedians who see the Bit Builder as a genuine tool for understanding joke structure. Writers, improv performers, comedy students. They'll evangelize this game because it *gets it* — it understands that comedy is a craft, not a talent.

### Comparable Games

1. **Game Dev Tycoon** meets **the Comedy Store**: The direct pitch. Game Dev Tycoon's satisfying loop of "build a creative product, release it to an audience, learn from the reaction, iterate" — but the creative product is a joke, the audience is alive and reactive, and the industry is the comedy world.

2. **Music Inc.** meets **Papers, Please**: The creative empire building of a music industry sim, combined with the moment-to-moment tension of performing under pressure. Every set is a performance where you're reading the room and making real-time decisions.

3. **Slay the Spire** meets **The Movies (Lionhead)**: The modular, card-based construction system of Slay the Spire (building a set from joke components) married to The Movies' Hollywood career simulation (managing talent, navigating industry politics, chasing cultural relevance).

4. **Football Manager** meets **Comedian (Seinfeld documentary)**: The obsessive stat-tracking and talent management of Football Manager, but instead of a football club, you're managing a comedy career. And instead of match simulations, you're watching sets play out against reactive audiences.

5. **Unpacking** meets **Hustle Culture**: The specificity and warmth of Unpacking's environmental storytelling — every green room, every dive bar, every napkin setlist tells a story — wrapped around a career simulation with genuine teeth.

### Unique Selling Proposition

There has never been a stand-up comedy simulation. Not a real one. There have been party games with comedy themes and rhythm games with joke timing. But nobody has built a game where you *construct jokes from components*, perform them to *reactive AI audiences*, and manage a *comedy career* from open mics to Netflix specials. Deadpan is a blue ocean product. It's not competing with other comedy games because there are no other comedy games. It's competing with tycoon games on novelty and comedy content on interactivity — and it wins both fights.

The hook in five seconds: "A game where you build jokes and perform them to AI audiences that can heckle you." That sentence has never been true before. It stops every scroll.

### Platform Fit

**PC (Steam)**: Primary. Tycoon and simulation games are Steam's bread and butter. The genre has a massive, dedicated audience that wishlists aggressively and buys on day one when the concept is novel. Steam tags will surface this to Game Dev Tycoon, Music Inc., and Two Point Hospital wishlists. The Bit Builder interface is mouse-native. Early Access is the natural path — the community will generate joke content, report audience balance issues, and become co-designers.

**Nintendo Switch**: Strong secondary. Tycoon games perform well on Switch (Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Campus). The session loop (30-60 minutes) fits portable play. The warm art style reads well on small screens.

**Mobile (iPad)**: Stretch target. The Bit Builder's drag-and-drop interface is touch-native. The session structure suits mobile play patterns. Potential for a streamlined mobile version focused on the joke construction and performance loop.

## THE SCOPE

### Feature Pillars (non-negotiable)

1. **The Bit Builder**: Modular joke construction with Premise, Setup, Misdirection, Punchline, Tag, and Callback components. Five humor axes (Cleverness, Relatability, Edge, Absurdity, Physicality). Thousands of viable combinations. The creative engine of the entire game. Without this, there is no game.

2. **The Crowd Engine**: AI audience system with distinct archetypes, venue-specific compositions, real-time collective and individual reactions, and emergent behaviors (heckling, walk-outs, standing ovations, viral moments). The audience is not a score — it's a living room. Without this, the Bit Builder has no mirror.

3. **The Laugh Graph**: Real-time and post-set performance visualization. Energy arcs, per-joke breakdowns, audience segment analysis. The diagnostic tool that makes iteration meaningful. Without this, the player can't learn.

4. **Voice Identity System**: Five-axis comedic identity tracking (Observational/Absurdist, Clean/Dark, Political/Personal, Cerebral/Physical, Warm/Confrontational). Authenticity scoring. Career path gating based on voice. The strategic layer that gives the career simulation teeth. Without this, all paths feel the same.

5. **Career Progression Arc**: Open Mic to Empire. Venue tiers, booking systems, agent relationships, media appearances, special tapings, podcast launches, development deals. The macro-loop that gives the joke-level micro-loop purpose and stakes. Without this, there's no reason to get better.

### Stretch Goals (ordered by impact)

1. **Comedy Crew System**: Form a comedy crew with AI comedians — share audiences, co-write material, tour together. Crews have their own reputation and identity. Think Chappelle's Show writers' room or the Comedians of Comedy tour. High impact because it adds a social/collaborative layer to what could feel like a solo grind.

2. **Heckler Duels**: When a heckler disrupts your set, enter a real-time verbal sparring mini-game. Quick-draw joke responses from your material library. Winning a heckler duel can turn a dying set into the best moment of the night. High impact because it creates emergent, shareable moments.

3. **Cultural Moment System**: The game world has trending topics, news cycles, and cultural shifts. Material that connects to the current cultural moment gets a relevance bonus. Material that becomes dated loses potency. Comedians who can ride the wave of a cultural moment break out faster. Medium-high impact because it makes the world feel alive and timely.

4. **Podcast Empire**: Launch a comedy podcast as a secondary revenue and audience-building channel. Interview AI comedians, react to comedy world events, build a listener base that converts into live show attendance. Medium impact because it adds a parallel career track.

5. **Writers' Room Mode**: Get hired to write for a late-night show or sitcom. A different gameplay mode focused on collaborative writing, punchup sessions, and navigating creative differences with showrunners and network executives. Medium impact because it adds variety and a new career path.

6. **Legacy Mode**: After reaching the top, start over as a new comedian in a world shaped by your previous playthrough. Your old character is now a legend (or a cautionary tale) in the scene. Your material exists in the culture. New challenge: build a career in the shadow of your own legacy. Medium impact for replayability.

### Cut List (NOT in v1)

- **Real-time spoken dialogue / voice acting for jokes**: The jokes are text-and-timing based, not voiced. Voicing would limit the combinatorial space of the Bit Builder and balloon the budget. The comedy lives in the writing and the audience reaction, not in delivery audio.
- **Multiplayer comedy battles**: Tempting, but the Bit Builder system is designed for thoughtful construction, not real-time competitive play. Save this for a potential sequel or expansion.
- **Procedural joke generation via LLM**: The player writes the jokes (by assembling components). The game does not write jokes for them. This is a design choice, not a technical limitation. The satisfaction comes from crafting something that works.
- **Open-world city exploration**: The city exists as a menu of venues, each richly illustrated, not as an explorable space. Walking around adds nothing to the core loop.
- **Dating sim subplot**: The comedy world has relationships, but they're professional, not romantic. Keep the focus on the craft and the career.

## KEY ART / MOOD DIRECTION

**Hero image**: A single spotlight cutting through haze, illuminating a mic stand on an empty stage. The brick wall behind it is covered in years of flyers and graffiti — club names, comedian names, show dates, all layered and half-torn. In the spotlight's cone, dust particles float like stars. The mic stand casts a long shadow that stretches toward the viewer, and in the shadow you can see the silhouette of a crowd — dozens of faces, some laughing, some arms-crossed, some holding up phones. The palette is warm and moody: `#1A1A2E` deep midnight for the room, `#E8D44D` rich gold for the spotlight, `#C0392B` worn brick red, `#F5F0E1` cream-white for the flyers, `#2ECC71` neon green buzzing at the edges. It looks like a place that smells like beer and possibility.

**UI mood**: Diegetic and tactile. Setlists are handwritten on `#F5F0E1` napkins in `#2C3E50` ink. The Bit Builder is a corkboard with index cards pinned to it, connected by `#E74C3C` red string. The career screen is a phone with text messages from agents, bookers, and rivals. The Laugh Graph is rendered on a `#1A1A2E` dark background with a `#E8D44D` gold waveform, like an audio visualizer in a recording studio. Venue selection is a stack of comedy club flyers with torn edges and coffee stains. Everything feels like something a working comedian would actually touch.

**Audio mood**: The soundscape IS the comedy world. Ambient crowd murmur that shifts from bored to engaged based on your set. The clinking of glasses. The squeak of a barstool. A muffled set happening in the next room. Between sets: lo-fi jazz and the hum of a green room — quiet conversations, nervous pacing, the scratch of pen on napkin. During performances: the crowd is the instrument. Laughter is the melody. Silence is the rest. A great set sounds like music. A bad set sounds like a room full of people trying not to make eye contact. The main menu theme is a warm, melancholic piano piece — something that sounds like 2 AM in a jazz club after the last comic went home, played over the ambient sound of a city that's still awake. Think Vince Guaraldi meets Mac DeMarco meets the quiet hum of a neon sign.

## OPEN QUESTIONS AND NEXT STEPS

### Design Questions [REED]
- What's the right number of joke components to keep the Bit Builder deep without overwhelming? Current design has six (Premise, Setup, Misdirection, Punchline, Tag, Callback) — is that one too many or one too few?
- How granular should the Crowd Engine's individual-vs-collective reaction system be? Do we simulate every audience member or cluster them into table groups?
- What's the Authenticity penalty curve? How hard should the game punish voice-shifting, and how quickly should it recover? Too harsh and players feel trapped; too lenient and the system has no teeth.
- How do we handle the "solved setlist" problem — preventing players from finding one optimal joke order and repeating it forever? Dynamic crowd composition helps, but is it enough?
- What's the pacing of new component card acquisition? Too fast and the Bit Builder gets overwhelming; too slow and sets feel stale.

### Narrative Questions [NOVA]
- How much backstory does the player character have? The "you bombed last night" opening implies a history — how much do we define vs. let the player imagine?
- What's the emotional texture of the AI comedians? Do they have visible struggles (addiction, family pressure, creative blocks) or are they purely professional rivals?
- How do we tell the story of the comedy world's darker side — the loneliness, the substance abuse, the exploitation by club owners — without making it a misery simulator? The tone has to stay warm enough that the player wants to stay.
- Where's the ending? Is there a definitive "you made it" moment, or does the game communicate that the hustle never stops? Both are true to comedy. Which is true to this game?

### Marketing Questions [HYPE]
- The comedy audience (podcast listeners, Netflix special watchers) is MASSIVE and almost entirely untapped by games. How do we reach them? Comedy podcast ad buys? Comedian influencer partnerships? Clips of the Crowd Engine reacting to player-built jokes are inherently shareable content.
- When do we announce? The Bit Builder GIF — dragging joke components onto a napkin, stepping up to the mic, watching the crowd react — is a day-one viral moment. We need that GIF before anything else.
- Do we do Early Access? The community balancing the Crowd Engine (reporting which audience archetypes feel off, which joke combinations feel over/underpowered) is invaluable. But Early Access comedy content could spoil the freshness. Tension to resolve.
- What's the demo? One venue (dive bar open mic), one pre-built set plus access to the Bit Builder to modify it, one performance. Enough to feel the loop.
- Comedian endorsements are the nuclear option. If a single working comedian tweets "this game gets it," the conversion rate will be unlike anything in the tycoon genre. Who do we approach?

### Next Steps

1. Prototype the Bit Builder with 20 component cards across all six types. Test joke assembly feel.
2. Prototype the Crowd Engine with a single venue (8-person open mic) and three audience archetypes. Test reaction feel.
3. Build the Laugh Graph visualization. Test readability and diagnostic utility.
4. Connect the Bit Builder to the Crowd Engine: assemble joke, perform joke, see reaction. This is the vertical slice. If this 30-second loop feels good, the game works.
5. Paper-design the Voice Identity System — map out the five spectra and how they gate career paths.
6. Paper-design the career progression arc — venue tiers, unlock conditions, pacing.
7. Art prototype: one venue (dive bar), the napkin setlist UI, the corkboard Bit Builder. Establish the visual language.
8. Audio prototype: crowd ambiance system with reactive laughter. This is half the game feel.
9. Steam page goes live the moment the Bit Builder GIF exists. Start building the wishlist.
10. Reach out to comedy podcasts for early coverage. The concept pitches itself.

*This pitch document was generated by REED (Game Designer), NOVA (Narrative Designer), and HYPE (Marketing). The game lives or dies on one question: can the Bit Builder make joke construction feel like a creative act — not a spreadsheet optimization — while the Crowd Engine makes every audience feel like a living room you're trying to win? If the answer is yes, Deadpan is the tycoon game nobody knew they were waiting for.*
