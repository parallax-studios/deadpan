# DEADPAN — Narrative Bible

*Written by NOVA, Narrative Designer*
*Every mechanic tells a story. The question is whether you're telling the right one.*

## 1. THE WORLD'S WOUND

The wound of Deadpan's world is **impermanence married to exposure**. Three fractures run through every brick wall, every green room mirror, every napkin setlist crumpled at 2 AM:

**The first fracture: Nothing lasts.** A joke kills tonight and dies tomorrow. A comic is the hottest thing in the scene for eleven months and then the algorithm moves on, the booker stops calling, the audience forgets the name but vaguely remembers the bit. The comedy world runs on attention, and attention is the most volatile substance on earth. Everyone in this world is building sandcastles at high tide and pretending they don't hear the ocean.

**The second fracture: The cost of being seen.** Comedy is the art of standing in the most visible spot in any room and turning your damage into entertainment. Every joke is a confession wearing a punchline as a disguise. The transaction is brutal in its simplicity: you give the audience your vulnerability, and they give you their laughter. But what happens when the audience loves the wound more than the person? What happens when the thing that makes you interesting to strangers is the thing that's destroying you in private?

**The third fracture: The distance between selves.** Every comic in this world is two people. There's the one on stage — sharper, louder, braver, meaner, funnier than any real person could sustain. And there's the one in the green room afterward, sitting in the quiet, wondering which version is the performance. The distance between stage-self and real-self is the central geography of this story. For some comics, that distance is a mile. For others, it's a millimeter. The ones where it's a millimeter are either the most honest artists in the world or the most broken people. Sometimes both.

**The World's Central Question:** *Is the truest version of you the one that makes strangers laugh, or the one that sits alone afterward?*

**The World's Big Lie:** That making it — the special, the tour, the Netflix deal — will close the distance. That success will make the stage-self and the real-self the same person. It won't. It just gives you a bigger stage on which to feel the gap.

**The World's Texture:** This world smells like stale beer and fresh anxiety. It sounds like a muffled punchline through a thin wall, like ice cubes shifting in a glass nobody's drinking from, like the particular quality of silence that follows a joke that didn't land — not hostile silence, just the absence of the thing you needed. It feels like 1 AM under fluorescent lights in a diner, your throat raw, your notebook open, your coffee cold, trying to figure out why the third bit died. It tastes like the two-drink minimum. It looks like a spotlight cone cutting through haze, making dust particles look like the last beautiful thing in the room.

## 2. WORLD-BUILDING

### Comedy Geography

The physical spaces of Deadpan are characters in their own right. Every venue has a personality, a history, and an opinion about who belongs there.

**The Open Mic Dive Bar** — The bottom of the ladder and the truest room in comedy. Sticky floors. A sound system held together with gaffer tape and optimism. The "stage" is a corner near the bathrooms with a single clip light and a mic stand that leans. The audience is fifteen people: eight of them are other comics waiting for their five minutes, three are regulars who come for the cheap beer and treat the comedy like background noise, two are someone's friends who were told "it'll be fun," one is on a date that's going badly, and one is a drunk who will either be the best audience member or the worst heckler. This room is democracy. This room doesn't care who you are. This room only cares if you're funny right now.

**The Comedy Club** — The middle kingdom. A real stage. Real lights. A brick wall that has absorbed ten thousand punchlines and gives nothing back. A two-drink minimum that makes the audience slightly more generous and slightly less predictable. The booker controls everything here — who gets the Tuesday 8 PM slot, who opens, who middles, who closes. The green room is a cramped space with a couch that has seen better decades, a mirror rimmed with dead bulbs, and a whiteboard with the set order written in dry-erase marker that never fully erases. This room is politics. This room is where careers are built or stalled based on relationships as much as talent.

**The Green Room** — Not a venue but the most important space in the game. The green room is where the masks come off — or where different masks go on. It's where comics are honest with each other in ways they'd never be on stage. It's where alliances form over shared cigarettes. It's where you hear that someone stole your bit, that the booker is cutting your time, that the headliner went long and burned through your closer's energy. The green room is the game's emotional interior. What does the player FEEL here? They feel the truth that the stage conceals.

**The Late-Night Studio** — The promised land for a certain kind of comic. Sterile and bright, the opposite of every room you've played. The audience is selected, warmed up, and coached. Everything is controlled. The set is tight — five minutes, no pivot points, no reading the room because the room has already been read for you. This is the paradox of making it: the biggest stage is the least alive room. You perform to a camera, not to people. The comic who thrives here is not always the comic who thrives in the wild.

**The Theater** — The empire stage. Two thousand seats. A sound system that makes your voice feel like it belongs to someone more important. The audience bought tickets specifically to see you, which means they arrive with expectations — and expectations are the enemy of surprise. The theater is where the tension between authenticity and brand becomes inescapable. You can't workshop new material here. They came for the hits.

**The Festival Tent** — Chaos energy. An outdoor stage or a converted conference room at a comedy festival where the audience is sunburned, overstimulated, and has already seen six sets today. The crowd composition is wildly unpredictable. Industry people are in the back with clipboards. This is where breakout moments happen, because the rules are suspended and nobody knows what to expect. The festival is a narrative accelerator — things happen here that would take months to unfold in the regular circuit.

### Starting Cities

Each starting city is a philosophy of comedy disguised as a geography.

**New York City** — The crucible. Comedy in New York is a blood sport played at speed. The scene is dense, competitive, and merciless. There are more rooms than any other city, but there are a hundred comics for every slot. The audience is sharp, impatient, and has seen everything. You can do five sets a night if you're willing to subway between boroughs at midnight. New York rewards volume, toughness, and material that hits fast. The unspoken rule: you earn respect by surviving. Nobody in New York cares where you came from. They care if you're funny at 11:45 PM on a Tuesday to a room that's been listening to comedy for three hours and is running out of patience. New York's gift is speed. New York's cost is burnout.

**Los Angeles** — The industry town. Comedy in LA is inextricable from the entertainment machine. Every set is an audition whether you want it to be or not. Industry scouts sit in the back of rooms, and the comics know it, and the material shifts accordingly — a little safer, a little more "produceable," a little more aware of its own brand potential. The rooms are spread across a sprawling geography, so you need a car and a podcast to fill the drive time. LA rewards marketability, networking, and having a "thing" — a clear, pitchable identity. The unspoken rule: talent is necessary but insufficient. You also need to be someone a producer can picture on a poster. LA's gift is opportunity. LA's cost is that it makes you think about your comedy as a product before you've finished figuring out what it is.

**Chicago** — The ensemble city. Comedy in Chicago is shaped by the improv tradition — collaboration over competition, scene over individual, craft over celebrity. The rooms are smaller but warmer. Comics write together, perform together, fail together. The Second City's shadow looms over everything, and the culture values intelligence, patience, and the long game. Chicago rewards depth, originality, and the willingness to be weird in front of people who appreciate weird. The unspoken rule: don't act like you're bigger than the scene. Chicago's gift is artistic integrity. Chicago's cost is that it can become a comfortable trap — so nurturing that leaving feels like betrayal.

**Austin** — The wild card. Comedy in Austin is loosened by the city's broader culture of creative weirdness. The scene is smaller, younger, and less codified. The rooms blur into music venues, podcast studios, and backyard shows. There's no established hierarchy, which means there's more space to experiment and less infrastructure to support you. Austin rewards risk-taking, authenticity, and the ability to build a following from scratch. The unspoken rule: be interesting, even if you're not consistent yet. Austin's gift is freedom. Austin's cost is that freedom can feel like invisibility.

### Culture: The Rules Nobody Writes Down

**The Open Mic Hierarchy** — Time is the only currency that matters. You start with three minutes. You earn five. Then seven. Then a regular ten-minute spot. Then a closing slot. Each step up is granted by the booker, and the booker's judgment is absolute and often inscrutable. Skipping the line — performing someone else's slot, going over your time, acting like you've earned what you haven't — is a social death sentence. The hierarchy exists because the scarcity is real: there are more comics than minutes.

**Booker Politics** — The booker is the most powerful person in any comedy club. They decide who performs, when, and for how long. A good relationship with a booker is worth more than a viral clip. Bookers have tastes, moods, loyalties, and grudges. They remember who was grateful and who was entitled. They remember who brought friends to fill seats and who didn't. The player must navigate these relationships without ever being told the rules explicitly, because the rules are unspoken and change by person.

**Comedy Crews** — Comics cluster into informal groups based on timing, style, and shared struggle. A crew is the people you came up with — the ones who were at the same open mics at the same time, who saw each other bomb, who workshopped bits in diners at 3 AM. Crews create loyalty, shared audiences, and sometimes creative partnerships. They also create insularity, groupthink, and the painful moment when one member of the crew breaks out and the others don't.

**Bit Theft Ethics** — The unforgivable sin. Stealing another comic's material — performing their bit, or a bit close enough that the origin is obvious — is the one thing the comedy world will not forgive. The ethics are clear in principle and agonizing in practice. What counts as theft? If two comics independently arrive at a similar premise, who owns it? If you riff on a topic someone else made famous, is that theft or homage? The game mechanizes this tension: if an AI comic performs material with a Humor Profile too close to yours on a bigger stage before you do, you lose claim to it. The injustice stings. And sometimes, you're the one who unknowingly drifted too close to someone else's lane.

**The Unspoken Contract with the Audience** — The audience gives you their attention. You owe them honesty — not factual honesty, but emotional honesty. They can feel when a comic is performing versus when a comic is present. The audience forgives imperfection. The audience does not forgive inauthenticity.

### Secrets

The comedy world's secrets are its deepest lore, revealed through play:

- The late-night bookers have a shared list of comics they'll never book, and the reasons are rarely about talent.
- The biggest comedy club in each city is in quiet financial trouble, and the booker's desperation creates opportunities for comics willing to fill last-minute cancellations — but at a cost to dignity.
- There is a legendary set — a mythic performance that happened years ago at a now-closed club — that every comic in the scene references but nobody recorded. Different comics remember it differently. The truth of what happened that night is one of the game's deepest narrative threads.
- Some AI comedians are secretly ghostwriting for more famous comics, and the discovery of this creates cascading narrative consequences.

## 3. CHARACTERS

### DELIA TORRENCE — The Mirror

**Role:** Rival and reluctant mentor. A mid-career comic who was exactly where the player is, five years ago.

**Desire:** To headline her own hour-long special and prove that her style of comedy — quiet, precise, devastatingly observational — can fill a room without gimmicks.

**Need:** To stop measuring her career against the comics who broke out while she was "doing it right." To accept that the path she chose is valid even if it's slower.

**Wound:** She was passed over for a late-night spot in favor of a less experienced comic with a bigger social media following. She has never recovered from the specific injustice of being told she was "not the right fit" by someone who couldn't explain what the right fit was.

**Lie:** That if she just keeps her head down and writes better material, the industry will eventually recognize her. That merit is the only variable.

**Arc:** Delia begins as an obstacle — she has the regular spot the player wants, and she's protective of her territory. Over time, she becomes the player's most honest critic, the one who tells them when a bit is lazy, when they're chasing the audience instead of leading it. Her arc resolves in one of two ways: she either finally gets her special and discovers it doesn't fix the wound, or she walks away from the chase and finds peace in being a comic's comic — respected by peers, unknown to the public, and quietly okay with that.

**Voice:** Measured. Dry. She speaks in complete sentences and rarely raises her voice. Her comedy is the same way — low-energy delivery that makes the punchlines land like delayed detonations. Off-stage, she's warmer than she appears, but she hides it behind precision. She uses silence as a weapon. Her pauses are longer than most people's sentences.

**Comedy Style:** Observational, cerebral, warm-leaning. Think Maria Bamford's intelligence in Tig Notaro's delivery. Her bits unfold slowly and reward patience.

**Gameplay Function:** Delia is the player's benchmark for quality. She's never the loudest comic in the room, but she's often the best. She serves as both rival (competing for spots and audiences) and mentor (giving the player feedback that is harsh but true). Her relationship with the player tracks the game's central theme: is it better to be good or to be successful?

### MARCUS "MARC" ELLISON — The Explosion

**Role:** Rival and cautionary tale. A comic who broke out fast and is burning bright enough to cast shadows.

**Desire:** To be the biggest comic in the country. Not one of the biggest. The biggest. He wants theaters, Netflix, late-night hosting, the whole machine.

**Need:** To sit still long enough to figure out why the silence between shows terrifies him. To build something that lasts instead of something that trends.

**Wound:** Marcus grew up invisible — the middle child in a loud family, the quiet kid in a school that rewarded noise. Comedy was the first time anyone paid attention to him, and he became addicted to the specific feeling of a room full of strangers choosing to look at him.

**Lie:** That the next level of fame will be the one where he finally feels seen enough. That the emptiness is a problem success will solve.

**Arc:** Marcus rises fast, and the player watches it happen — the viral clips, the agent, the development deal. He's generous early on, bringing the player along to shows, sharing green room intel. But as his career accelerates, he becomes competitive, then territorial, then paranoid that the player is catching up. His arc is a tragedy of success: he gets everything he wanted and discovers it's a room he has to keep filling. If the player maintains their relationship through his rise, they can pull him back from the edge. If not, Marcus flames out spectacularly — a public meltdown that becomes material for every other comic in the scene.

**Voice:** Fast, loud, kinetic. Marcus talks like he's afraid that if he pauses, the audience will leave. His comedy is the same — dense with punchlines, physically big, designed to overwhelm rather than linger. Off-stage, there are rare moments of quiet where a different person is visible, but he changes the subject before anyone can look too long.

**Comedy Style:** Physical, absurdist, dark-leaning. Think early Eddie Murphy's energy in Bo Burnham's self-awareness. His sets are events. His material is wide rather than deep.

**Gameplay Function:** Marcus is the player's measuring stick for success — the comic whose career trajectory defines what "making it" looks like. He's also a warning: the player can see, in real time, what happens when you optimize for audience size instead of audience connection.

### JOAN PARK — The Architect

**Role:** Booker and gatekeeper. She runs the most important mid-level club in the player's starting city.

**Desire:** To build the best comedy room in the country — a place where the lineup is so consistently good that the club's reputation becomes self-sustaining.

**Need:** To forgive herself for the comic she passed over twelve years ago who went on to become a legend. To accept that her eye for talent is good but not infallible.

**Wound:** She was a comic herself, once. She was good enough to know she wasn't great, and the clarity of that knowledge was more painful than failure would have been. She became a booker because she couldn't stop loving comedy and couldn't keep standing in the light.

**Lie:** That she's on the other side of the glass by choice. That she's happier shaping the scene than she would have been in it.

**Arc:** Joan begins as an authority figure — the person who decides if the player gets stage time. Her approval is currency. Over time, the player earns enough of her trust to see the person behind the clipboard. Her arc is about whether the player treats her as a means to an end (booking gigs) or as a human being who made a choice she's still grieving. If the player invests in the relationship, Joan becomes their most powerful ally — not because she gives them better slots, but because she tells them the truth about the industry that no one else will.

**Voice:** Clipped, efficient, occasionally cutting. Joan speaks like someone who's heard ten thousand pitches and can spot bullshit at fifty paces. She does not waste words. When she's impressed, she shows it by giving you more time, not by telling you. Her rare compliments land like sledgehammers because of their scarcity.

**Comedy Style:** N/A (retired), but her taste leans toward smart, original material. She has no patience for hacky premises or borrowed rhythms.

**Gameplay Function:** Joan is the primary gatekeeper for the club tier. Her relationship score determines access to prime slots, opening for headliners, and eventually, a regular spot. She's the player's introduction to the political dimension of comedy — the truth that talent without relationships goes nowhere.

---

### PETE DELGADO — The Ghost

**Role:** Mentor figure and cautionary tale. A legendary comic from the previous generation who never got his due.

**Desire:** Ostensibly, nothing. Pete says he's retired. He says he's at peace. He comes to open mics to watch, not to perform.

**Need:** To perform one more time. To stand in the light again and find out if the thing that made him special is still there, buried under decades of disappointment.

**Wound:** Pete was on the verge of a breakout twenty years ago — a late-night set was booked, an agent was circling, the momentum was real. Then a more famous comic released a special with material so close to Pete's voice that Pete's entire act felt derivative overnight. He wasn't stolen from, exactly. The similarity was coincidental. But the timing was lethal. The late-night set was cancelled. The agent moved on. Pete kept performing for three more years, each set haunted by the feeling that the audience was hearing an echo. He stopped.

**Lie:** That he doesn't miss it. That walking away was wisdom, not surrender.

**Arc:** Pete enters the story as a quiet presence — the older guy at the back of the open mic who nods when a bit lands and looks away when it doesn't. The player can seek him out or ignore him. If they invest in the relationship, Pete becomes the game's deepest mentor — not teaching technique (the player has the Bit Builder for that) but teaching philosophy. Why you write. Who you write for. What comedy is when you strip away the career. His arc culminates in a choice: the player can encourage Pete to perform one final set at an open mic. If he does, it's one of the game's most emotionally charged scenes. Whether it goes well or badly, the act of returning to the light — choosing to be seen again after twenty years of hiding — is the arc's resolution.

**Voice:** Slow, warm, self-deprecating in a way that sounds like peace but is actually scar tissue. Pete tells stories instead of making arguments. He references comedians the player has never heard of. He laughs easily at other people's jokes, which is the tell — the person who laughs the most easily at comedy is the person who loves it the most desperately.

**Comedy Style:** Personal, warm, observational. Think Mitch Hedberg's specificity with Bill Hicks's conviction. His material, when he finally performs it, is twenty years old and somehow still true.

**Gameplay Function:** Pete is the game's emotional anchor. His mentorship provides narrative context for the mechanical systems — he explains, through story and philosophy, what the Bit Builder, the Crowd Engine, and the Voice Identity system mean in human terms. He's also the game's argument that comedy has value beyond career metrics.

---

### ALEXIS WADE — The Algorithm

**Role:** Rival and dark mirror. A comic who has reverse-engineered what audiences want and builds material to specification.

**Desire:** To prove that comedy is a solvable system — that if you understand the audience deeply enough, you can manufacture laughter with scientific precision.

**Need:** To write one joke that surprises herself. To feel the thing she sees other comics feel when a bit lands that they didn't know would work.

**Lie:** That optimization and artistry are the same thing. That if the audience laughs, the joke is good, full stop.

**Arc:** Alexis is the player's ideological rival. Her comedy is effective — her sets reliably kill, her metrics are strong, her career advances steadily. But there's something missing, a warmth, an unpredictability, a humanness that audiences can't articulate but can feel. Her arc is about whether she can survive the moment when her system stops working — when an audience doesn't respond to the formula and she has to improvise from a place of genuine feeling for the first time. If the player has built a relationship with her, they can help her through that crisis. If not, she doubles down on the system and becomes increasingly successful and increasingly hollow.

**Voice:** Precise, analytical, casually competitive. Alexis talks about comedy the way a chess player talks about openings — with respect for the opponent and absolute confidence in the method. She uses data language without being robotic: "That bit tests well with the 25-34 demo" is something she says without irony. Beneath the analysis, there's a person who genuinely loves making people laugh but has buried that love under layers of strategy.

**Comedy Style:** Observational, clean-leaning, high relatability. Engineered for maximum accessibility. Her sets are tight, well-paced, and structurally impeccable. They are also, to a trained ear, slightly sterile — like a pop song that hits every beat but doesn't haunt you.

**Gameplay Function:** Alexis is the mechanical foil to the Voice Identity system. She represents the path of pure optimization — maximizing Laugh Graph performance at the cost of Authenticity. She forces the player to confront the question: if the numbers are good, does it matter that the art feels empty?

### RAY SANTOS — The Furnace

**Role:** Collaborator and emotional wildcard. A comic whose personal chaos generates extraordinary material and extraordinary collateral damage.

**Desire:** To be understood. Not famous, not successful — understood. Ray wants one person in the audience to hear a bit and think, "That's exactly how I feel and I didn't know anyone else felt it."

**Need:** To stop using the stage as therapy. To find a way to process pain that doesn't require an audience.

**Wound:** Ray's family fell apart publicly and messily when he was nineteen, and he turned the wreckage into a set that killed at an open mic the same week. He learned, in a single formative moment, that his suffering had market value. He has been converting pain into punchlines ever since, and the exchange rate is destroying him.

**Lie:** That if he can make the pain funny, he's in control of it. That laughter is the same as healing.

**Arc:** Ray is magnetic and unstable. His sets are electric — raw, confessional, unpredictable. He's the comic other comics come to watch because you never know what he'll do. He's also the comic who cancels gigs, burns bridges, and disappears for weeks. His arc is a tightrope walk: the player can become his collaborator (co-writing material, touring together, building a creative partnership) or his enabler (encouraging the chaos because it produces great comedy). The player's choices determine whether Ray finds sustainable creative practice or whether the furnace consumes its fuel.

**Voice:** Erratic, poetic, confessional. Ray speaks in fragments that occasionally coalesce into something beautiful. He interrupts himself. He follows tangents that turn out to be the point. On stage, the chaos is controlled — barely — and the audience feels the tension between falling apart and holding it together. Off stage, the chaos is less controlled.

**Comedy Style:** Personal, dark, confrontational, physical. Think early Richard Pryor's rawness with Hannah Gadsby's structural ambition. His material is not for everyone, and the audience members it's for will follow him anywhere.

**Gameplay Function:** Ray is the player's access to high-risk, high-reward collaboration. Co-writing with Ray produces material with extreme Humor Profiles — very high Edge, very high Physicality, polarizing audience reactions. He's also the game's embodiment of the authenticity-destruction paradox: the most genuine material comes from the most damaging places.

## 4. TONE GUIDE

### Adjectives

**Warm. Gritty. Specific. Melancholic. Alive.**

This world is warm in the way a bar at last call is warm — not because it's comfortable, but because the people in it have been there long enough to lower their defenses. It's gritty in the way that real creative work is gritty: not aesthetic filth, but the unglamorous reality of doing the thing you love in rooms that don't always love you back. It's specific — this is not "comedy" in the abstract but comedy as a physical, social, economic, and emotional reality, rendered with the detail of someone who knows what the green room at The Stand smells like at 11 PM. It's melancholic because the best comedy comes from the same place as the best sadness, and the game never pretends otherwise. It's alive because the rooms are full of people who chose to be there, and every set is a conversation, not a broadcast.

### Tone References

- **Comedian (Jerry Seinfeld documentary)** — for the specific anxiety and thrill of performing material in front of human beings.
- **Atlanta (Donald Glover)** — for the way it depicts a creative industry as both absurd and deadly serious, with tonal shifts that feel like real life.
- **The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel** — for the period-agnostic warmth and the understanding that comedy is a world with its own rules, hierarchies, and heartbreaks.
- **Bo Burnham: Inside** — for the meta-awareness that performing is both necessary and destructive, that the audience is both the cure and the disease.
- **Unpacking (game)** — for environmental specificity, for the belief that a room tells you everything about the person who lives in it.
- **Night in the Woods (game)** — for the warmth-melancholy balance, for characters who are funny and sad in the same breath.

### Dialogue Rules

- **Casual over formal.** Comics speak like real people, not like characters in a movie about comedy. Contractions, interruptions, half-finished thoughts.
- **Funny but not joke-dense.** The world is full of people who are funny for a living, but they don't perform in conversation. The humor is in the observation, the timing, the understatement — not in constructed punchlines.
- **Subtext over text.** Comics almost never say what they mean directly. They deflect with humor. They answer questions with questions. The player learns to read what's underneath.
- **Silences count.** A character not responding is a response. A pause before an answer means something. Dialogue direction should note where the silence lives.
- **No exposition dumps.** Information about the comedy world is communicated through character behavior, not through lectures. The player learns the rules by watching what happens when someone breaks them.

### What This World Is NOT

- **It is not a parody of comedy.** The game respects comedy as an art form. The jokes are not jokes about jokes. The characters are not caricatures of comedians.
- **It is not a misery simulator.** The world has darkness — loneliness, addiction, exploitation, failure — but the dominant emotional register is warmth. People in this world love what they do, even when what they do hurts them. The player should want to stay.
- **It is not cynical.** The industry has cynical mechanics (booker politics, bit theft, the algorithm's indifference) but the people in it are not cynical. Even the most jaded characters still believe, somewhere deep, that a perfect joke in a perfect room is the closest thing to magic.
- **It is not clean.** This world has edges. Comics say things that are uncomfortable. The humor is not sanitized. But the edge serves emotional truth, not shock.
- **It is not nostalgic.** The game is not about a golden age of comedy. It's about comedy now — with social media, algorithms, podcasts, and all the messy complexity of trying to be a live performer in a digital world.

### Sample Passages

**Passage 1: The Green Room Before a Set**

> The green room at Rudy's smells like every green room you've ever been in — hairspray and nervous sweat and the ghost of a thousand cigarettes smoked before the city banned smoking indoors. The couch has a canyon in the middle where ten years of comics have sat and sunk. There's a whiteboard on the wall with tonight's set order, and you're third, which means you go up after the crowd has warmed but before they've peaked. Good slot. Not great. You can hear the MC through the wall, muffled into incomprehension, and then the particular quality of laughter that means the audience is ready to laugh but hasn't been given a reason yet. That's the best sound in comedy — potential energy. The door to the stage has a piece of tape over the latch so it doesn't slam. Someone put that tape there years ago. Nobody knows who. Everybody respects it.

**Passage 2: After a Bad Set**

> You come off stage and the green room is just — there. The same couch. The same dead bulbs around the mirror. Delia is sitting in the corner looking at her phone, and she doesn't look up, which is how you know she watched your set, because Delia always looks up when she didn't watch. The silence is the specific silence of someone choosing not to say "tough crowd," because you both know it wasn't the crowd. It was the third bit. You felt it go — the exact moment the room decided to be patient instead of entertained, and patience is the first step toward indifference. You sit on the couch and it makes that sound. You take out the napkin with your setlist and stare at it like it's going to explain itself.

**Passage 3: The Moment Before the Mic**

> The MC says your name, and for one second — less than a second, a fraction of a breath — you are nobody. The audience hasn't decided yet. The spotlight is on the mic stand and you are walking toward it through dark that smells like beer and possibility, and in this sliver of time before your hand touches the mic and your mouth opens and the first word comes out and the room begins to form its opinion, you are free. You are pure potential. You are the funniest person alive and you are the worst comic who ever lived and you are both of those things simultaneously, like a coin spinning in the air, and you will not know which side lands until the first joke either hits or doesn't. Your hand closes around the mic. It's warm from the last comic. You adjust the stand. You look out at the light. And you begin.

## 5. NARRATIVE-MECHANIC INTEGRATION

*Every mechanic tells a story. The question is whether you're telling the right one.*

### The Bit Builder Tells a Story About Craft

The Bit Builder — the modular joke construction system — is not just a gameplay mechanic. It is the game's argument that comedy is a craft, not a talent. By making the player physically assemble jokes from components (Premise, Setup, Misdirection, Punchline, Tag, Callback), the game embeds a narrative truth in every interaction: funny is not something you are, it's something you build. The first time a player drags a Punchline onto a Setup and hears the crowd respond, they feel the specific satisfaction of having made something. That feeling — I built this, and it worked — is the emotional engine of the entire game. It is also the emotional engine of every real comedian's career. The mechanic IS the narrative.

### The Voice Identity System Tells a Story About Authenticity

The five spectra of the Voice Identity system (Observational/Absurdist, Clean/Dark, Political/Personal, Cerebral/Physical, Warm/Confrontational) are not just strategic axes. They are the game's way of asking the player: who are you? Every joke you build pushes your Voice in a direction. Every performance reinforces or challenges your identity. The Authenticity score — which tracks whether you're consistent with your established Voice — is the game's mechanical expression of the central theme. Drift too far from your Voice and you lose your core fans before building new ones. Stay too rigidly within your Voice and you never grow. The tension between consistency and evolution, between giving the audience what they want and giving them what you need to give them, is the tension of every creative career. The mechanic tells the story of identity.

What does the player FEEL here? They feel the pull. They feel the temptation to write a crowd-pleasing bit that doesn't feel like them. They feel the risk of trying something new and watching the Authenticity score dip. They feel the satisfaction of expanding their Voice deliberately and the audience following them into new territory.

### The Laugh Graph Is an Emotional Mirror

The Laugh Graph — the real-time waveform of audience engagement — is the game's most intimate feedback system. It shows you, in the visual language of a heartbeat monitor, the exact shape of your connection to a room full of strangers. Peaks are the moments you reached them. Valleys are the moments you lost them. The graph after a great set looks like a mountain range, and the player feels triumph. The graph after a bad set looks like a flatline, and the player feels the specific nausea of having been seen and found wanting. The Laugh Graph is not a score. It is a mirror. And the story it tells is different every time.

### Bombing Creates Narrative Depth

Failure in Deadpan is not a punishment — it is a narrative event. When the player bombs, the game does not simply display a low score. The audience reacts: the couple in the front row whispers to each other. The drunk guy starts heckling. The fellow comics in the back look at their phones. The room contracts. The green room afterward is a different place — Delia's silence means something different, Marcus's absence is louder, Joan's face when she sees you leave the stage tells a story in a glance.

Bombing is where the game's deepest emotional content lives. The player's relationship to failure — how they respond to it, what they learn from it, whether they let it define them — is the narrative arc of the game. A player who has never bombed has never played Deadpan. A player who has bombed and come back has lived the game's central story.

### Environmental Storytelling in Venues

Every venue tells a story before a single joke is performed. The dive bar's sticky floor and clip light tell a story about democracy and desperation. The comedy club's brick wall and two-drink minimum tell a story about tradition and gatekeeping. The late-night studio's sterile brightness tells a story about the distance between comedy and the entertainment industry. The theater's two thousand empty seats, waiting to be filled, tell a story about the weight of expectation.

The details matter: the tape over the green room door latch. The whiteboard with set orders half-erased, palimpsests of every comic who came before. The flyers on the wall for shows that happened years ago, the names of comics who moved away or quit or died or got famous. The napkins with setlists scrawled in handwriting that gets less legible as the night goes on. Every environmental detail is a narrative choice. Who is this character when no one's watching? A venue is a character. What is it when the lights are off and the comics have gone home?

### The Crowd Engine Tells a Story About Connection

The Crowd Engine — with its individual archetypes, collective energy states, and emergent behaviors — is not just a gameplay system. It is the game's simulation of the most fundamental human transaction: one person trying to make another person feel something. Every audience composition is a narrative setup. A room full of Comedy Nerds is a story about earning the respect of your peers. A room full of Date Night Couples is a story about breaking through distraction. A room full of Fellow Comedians is a story about being judged by the people who understand exactly what you're doing and how hard it is. The Crowd Engine makes every performance a story about connection — sometimes achieved, sometimes failed, always attempted.

## 6. LORE HIERARCHY

### Need-to-Know (The player MUST understand this to play)

- Comedy is a craft. Jokes are built, not born.
- Audiences are different. What kills at a dive bar open mic may bomb at a college show.
- The comedy world has a hierarchy: open mic, regular spot, headliner, theater, special. You climb it by being funny and being known.
- Your Voice Identity matters. Audiences and the industry will form expectations based on the kind of comedy you make. Consistency builds a following. Change is risky but necessary for growth.
- Relationships with bookers, rivals, and collaborators shape your career as much as your material does.
- You bombed last night. Everything starts from here.

### Want-to-Know (Enriches the experience for curious players)

- Each starting city has a distinct comedy culture that shapes the kind of comic it produces. New York is speed and survival. LA is industry and marketability. Chicago is craft and collaboration. Austin is freedom and risk.
- The AI comedians have their own careers, struggles, and trajectories. They're not just obstacles — they're people.
- Bookers have histories. Joan used to be a comic. Learning why she stopped changes how you understand her judgments.
- The green room is where the truth lives. Pay attention to what characters say (and don't say) in the space between sets.
- Comedy crews form naturally and provide benefits, but they also create obligations and complicate rivalries.
- The comedy world has a memory. Your early sets, your first bomb, your biggest night — the scene remembers, and those memories shape how people treat you.

### Deep Lore (Rewards dedicated fans and lore hunters)

- The legendary set — the mythic performance at the now-closed club that every comic references differently — actually happened. The comic who performed it is Pete Delgado. The material was about his father. The club closed six months later, unrelated, but the mythology merged the two events into a single story about a set so good it ended a room.
- Alexis Wade's optimization system is based on a theoretical framework she found in an unpublished comedy theory manuscript in a used bookstore in Chicago. The manuscript was written by a comic who quit the business in the 1980s. The comic was Joan Park's mentor.
- Marcus Ellison's family doesn't know he's a comedian. He told them he works in marketing. His material about invisibility is more literal than his audience realizes.
- The dive bar open mic in each city has a tradition: the last comic of the night turns off the lights. Nobody knows who started it. It continues because ritual is how comics manage the terror of doing this again tomorrow.
- There is a comedy festival that happens once a year in a location that changes — a barn in Vermont, a warehouse in Detroit, a beach house in North Carolina. It's invitation-only, and the invitations come from a comic who has been retired for fifteen years and still knows everyone. Getting invited is the scene's highest honor. Very few audience members ever attend. The material performed there is never recorded.
- Ray Santos once performed a forty-five-minute set entirely about a single day — the day his mother left — and it is considered by the comics who witnessed it to be the greatest set ever performed. Ray has never done it again. He says he can't remember it.

### Never-Told (Exists for internal consistency; the player never sees this)

- The game's comedy world exists in a universe where a handful of real-world comedy legends never existed. This is why there's room in the cultural landscape for the player and the AI comedians to occupy niches that, in our world, are already claimed. The specific absences are never named because naming them would break immersion.
- Joan Park's decision to stop performing was also influenced by a specific incident of harassment by a club owner that she has never told anyone about. This informs her protectiveness of her room and her particular attentiveness to how comics are treated in her club, but the incident itself is never revealed.
- The game's internal calendar system tracks a five-year span. Comedy trends, cultural moments, and audience tastes shift across that span following a pattern based on research into real comedy boom-and-bust cycles.
- Each AI comedian's material library contains approximately 200 joke profiles, of which the player will encounter maybe 40 over the course of a playthrough. The unseen material exists to ensure that the AI comedians feel like they have lives and careers beyond the player's awareness.

## 7. TIMELINE OF A COMEDY CAREER

*The emotional arc of Deadpan, mapped to game progression.*

### ACT ONE: THE WRECKAGE (Weeks 1-4)

**The Narrative Seed:** You bombed last night. Your agent hasn't called. You're sitting in your apartment with a notebook, a cold coffee, and a question: *Do I still have it?*

**What the player FEELS:** Vulnerability. Smallness. The specific dread of knowing you have to go back to the open mic and stand in the light again after the light burned you. But also — beneath the dread — a stubborn, irrational spark. The voice that says: *I know I'm funny. I just have to prove it again.*

**Mechanical reality:** The player has access to a limited component library. Venues are open mics only. The Crowd Engine is unforgiving — small rooms with comics and regulars who have no reason to care. The Bit Builder feels limiting, which is the point: the player is rebuilding from the ground up.

**Key narrative beats:**
- First open mic back. The terror of the walk from the door to the mic. The relief of a single laugh, even a small one.
- Meeting Pete at the back of the room. He nods. That's all. It's enough.
- First encounter with Delia, who has the regular spot the player wants. She's not hostile, but she's not welcoming. She's evaluating.
- First bomb. Real bomb. The room goes silent and stays silent. The Laugh Graph flatlines. The green room afterward.
- First set that works. Not kills — works. The room was with you. You felt it. The Laugh Graph has a shape. It's a small mountain range, but it's yours.

**The emotional arc of Act One:** From wreckage to first proof. The player rebuilds belief in themselves one set at a time.

### ACT TWO: THE GRIND (Weeks 5-16)

**The Narrative Seed:** You're getting better. The open mics are consistent now. Joan has noticed. A regular spot is possible. But the grind is relentless, and the comics who were at your level are starting to diverge — some rising, some plateauing, some disappearing.

**What the player FEELS:** Pride and exhaustion in equal measure. The satisfaction of craft — sets are tighter, material is stronger, the Bit Builder feels like an instrument instead of a puzzle. But also the creeping question: is this enough? Marcus is blowing up. Alexis is booking gigs the player can't get. The world is bigger than the open mic, and the climb is steeper than it looked from the bottom.

**Mechanical reality:** Component library expands. Club-level venues open. The Voice Identity system begins to coalesce — the player has made enough jokes to have a profile, and the game starts tracking Authenticity. Rival AI comedians begin competing for the same slots. Relationship management becomes important. The Crowd Engine introduces more complex audience compositions.

**Key narrative beats:**
- Earning a regular spot at Joan's club. The conversation where she tells you — not in so many words, because Joan never uses so many words — that she thinks you're ready.
- Marcus's viral moment. A clip of his set explodes online. He goes from peer to phenomenon overnight. The player watches it happen and feels something complicated.
- First encounter with Alexis. She's pleasant, competent, and subtly measuring you. She knows your Laugh Graph numbers before you do.
- The bit theft scare. A comic performs material similar to the player's on a bigger stage. The injustice is sharp. The community's response teaches the player how the ethics of comedy work.
- Writing a bit that surprises you. A moment in the Bit Builder where a combination of components produces something the player didn't expect — a joke that's funnier than the sum of its parts, that reveals something about their Voice they didn't know was there.
- Pete's first real conversation. In a diner at 2 AM, he tells the player about a set he performed twenty years ago, and doesn't finish the story. The gap is the story.

**The emotional arc of Act Two:** From grind to identity. The player discovers who they are as a comic — not just what material they write, but what their comedy means.

### ACT THREE: THE BREAKOUT (Weeks 17-30)

**The Narrative Seed:** Something catches. A clip. A review. A booker from a bigger room. The world that was ignoring you now has opinions about you, and opinions are a different kind of pressure than indifference.

**What the player FEELS:** Euphoria and vertigo. The thrill of bigger rooms, louder laughs, real money. But also the pressure to repeat the thing that worked, to become the version of yourself that the audience already likes instead of the version you're becoming. The Voice Identity system becomes a strategic pressure cooker: stay true or go broad?

**Mechanical reality:** Theater-level venues open. Agent and media mechanics activate. Late-night bookings become possible. The Crowd Engine introduces industry audiences with high stakes. The Voice Identity system's Authenticity tension peaks — the player must make real choices about their creative direction. Rival arcs accelerate: Marcus is at his peak, Delia is at her crossroads, Alexis is thriving, Ray is spiraling.

**Key narrative beats:**
- The first big room. Two hundred people. They bought tickets. They have expectations. The setlist has to be good enough to justify the trust.
- The agent call. Someone wants to represent you. The conversation reveals what the industry sees when it looks at your comedy — and it may not be what you see.
- The late-night set. Five minutes. No pivot points. The most controlled room you've ever played. The set goes well or it doesn't, and either way, you learn something about the difference between performing and being produced.
- Marcus's crisis. His career is at its peak and his personal life is at its nadir. The player can reach out or step back. The choice defines the relationship.
- Ray's spiral. His material is the best it's ever been and he is the worst he's ever been. The player must decide: collaborator or enabler?
- The moment the player realizes that the Authenticity score and the success metrics are pulling in different directions. The game does not resolve this tension. The player must.

**The emotional arc of Act Three:** From breakout to reckoning. The player confronts the central question: is the best version of my comedy the version the world wants, or the version I need to make?

### ACT FOUR: THE EMPIRE (Weeks 31-52)

**The Narrative Seed:** You have the special. You have the tour. The career machine is running. And in the green room of a theater that holds more people than you've ever seen in one place, you look at the napkin setlist and feel something familiar. The same terror. The same spark. The same question you had at the first open mic: *Am I funny?*

**What the player FEELS:** Power and emptiness. The satisfaction of having built something — a career, a voice, a body of work. But also the hollowness of discovering that the top of the mountain looks a lot like the bottom, just with better lighting. The game's final emotional argument: the goal was never the special. The goal was always the set. The goal was always the room. The goal was always the terrifying, exhilarating, irreplaceable transaction of standing in the light and trying to make strangers feel something.

**Mechanical reality:** All venues and career mechanics are open. The player can tape a special, launch a podcast empire, mentor younger comics, or go back to the open mic and try new material. The game does not end — it transforms. The question shifts from "how do I make it?" to "what do I do with having made it?"

**Key narrative beats:**
- The special taping. The culmination of the mechanical journey. A full set, performed to a packed room, recorded for broadcast. The setlist is the player's choice, and the choice is the statement.
- Pete's final set. If the player has invested in the relationship, Pete returns to the stage. The room holds its breath. The outcome is uncertain. The attempt is everything.
- Delia's resolution. She gets her special, or she doesn't. Either way, the player sees what the outcome means to her and learns something about what "making it" means — and what it costs.
- The open mic return. Late in the game, the player can go back to the dive bar where they started and perform new material to fifteen people. The room is the same. The player is not. The Laugh Graph from this set — small, intimate, without stakes or audience or industry or brand — may be the most meaningful graph in the game.
- The final question, unspoken, unanswered, delivered through gameplay and not through text: *Was it worth it?*

**The emotional arc of Act Four:** From empire to meaning. The player discovers that the game's central tension — authenticity versus success — was never meant to be resolved. It was meant to be lived.

## CLOSING NOTE

*From NOVA's desk:*

Deadpan is a game about a person standing in a cone of light, trying to make strangers laugh. That's the mechanical reality. But the narrative reality — the story the player lives through the systems, the characters, the spaces, the silence between punchlines — is about something larger. It's about the courage it takes to be seen. It's about the distance between who you perform and who you are. It's about the impossible, necessary, beautiful transaction of turning your damage into someone else's joy.

Every mechanic in this game tells a story. The Bit Builder tells a story about craft. The Voice Identity system tells a story about authenticity. The Laugh Graph tells a story about connection. The Crowd Engine tells a story about the unknowable mystery of other people. And the career progression — from open mic to empire — tells a story about what happens when you get the thing you wanted and discover that the wanting was the point.

The world's wound is impermanence. Nothing lasts. Not the joke, not the laugh, not the career, not the moment. But the act of standing in the light and trying — that lasts. That's what the player carries when they close the game. Not the metrics. Not the career tier. The memory of a room that was cold, and a joke that was right, and a silence that broke into laughter, and the feeling — just for a second — that the distance between who you are and who you pretend to be was zero.

That's the story of Deadpan. And every mechanic tells it.
